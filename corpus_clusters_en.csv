This brings a human and ethical question which I will not try to solve in this particular article, but it's one worth discussing. I do recommend the book “Rise Of The Robots: Technology and the Threat Of A Jobless Future” by Martin Ford, although I am an optimist and I believe we can figure something out, it is good to know the cautionary tale, and remember it. But back to 2019, in sum, many companies are taking advantage of RPA and trying to re-skill their employees to move them to other areas. Even with the effort, Forrester predicts that RPA software will threaten the livelihood of at least 230 million workers, or about 9% of the global workforce.

So before you talk about how evil it is, tell me first if you use it. But back to the point--like digital transformation, transcendence is never really done. It needs to tie into the overall strategy and be a continual change in how the company operates. Although the vision is there, the execution can be a struggle, with some experts estimating that more than half of companies that try to transform don’t end up hitting the desired business result. hought it was interesting--I was fascinated by human behavior and by the idea of a brand. I've been lucky enough to work in some type of ""customer"" area since 2007, starting off in the conference industry, then media about customer management (that's what we called it), moving on to work in customer service for a Fortune 100 tech company for two years and focusing purely on customer experience thought leadership for the last three years. I've watched as the word ""customer"" has gained increasing influence--from the time when Tony Hsieh, CEO and founder of Zappos, was the only  person talking about customer service, to now when everyone is talking about customer experience all the time. The phrase ""customer experience"" gets a lot more play than it did in the business world in the past, when people would simply throw it around synonymously with the phrase ""customer service."" We've established these two things are definitely not the same. Customer experience is now seen as a key business strategy for every brand.  on the phone with a customer. This tactic is the best of both worlds: customers still get the personal interaction they crave, but they also get the speed and efficiency of a chatbot and don’t have to wait for agents to manually look through huge amounts of constantly changing insurance information.

It happens when a car company decides to leave the gas business or when a mattress company that only sold products online decides to open retail store to showcase its products. It happens when companies completely change their offering, like moving from retail to 100% digital, or changing the sales model to offer subscription models rather than traditional offerings.

He told me in an emailed interview, “As we have seen recently, perceived ethical failures can deprecate brands in an instant,” noting that in the future companies will need to have a better understanding of AI and the impacts of data security. “We used to say that every company would become a software company, but that has quickly morphed into not only is every company a software company, but every one is also an AI company. A consequence of this is that every company will have to develop an AI Manifesto, which is an expression of their beliefs and behaviors in the ethical use of data and AI technologies. In 2019, we will see a few companies start to differentiate by publishing their AI manifestos to their employees, customers, partners and shareholders.” eir business model in the next three years. Some companies completely clean house with a major transformation that alters nearly everything about the company, while others take a more tactical approach and only address small areas within the organization. You cannot talk about transcendence without talking about Amazon. An older but still relevant book that details their rise is “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age Of Amazon” by Brad Stone, who was given exclusive access at Amazon. Amazon has pivoted from modestly selling books, riding the wave of the late 1990’s dot-com boom to sell music, movies, electronics and toys, while avoiding disaster in the 2000 bust. I never had heard of Amazon until around the time I graduated college, and I became a customer in 2009 when I was living in Brooklyn, NY. Throughout this period Amazon “mastered the physics of its own complex distribution network” and expanded into everything. After earning the spot of top retailer, it redefined itself again as an unstoppable technology firm that sold cloud computing infrastructure as Amazon Web Services. In addition to the Kindle e-reader and tablet. The purchase of The Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million and Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017 continued to shock the world, but as time goes on these purchases make increasingly more sense. Amazon’s customer experience mindset, coupled with its focus on constant innovation, and lack of fear of being misunderstood for long periods of time makes them powerful. What might surprise people is Jeff Bezos is himself rooted in reality and the unavoidable vicissitudes of business. Jeff Bezos does believe one day Amazon could go bankrupt and fail. Most people would be shocked to know this guy talks that way. And as I said, I visited Amazon a few weeks ago, and what I found surprised me - normal, hard working, thoughtful and service-oriented people. I met a VP of Logistics who does ride-alongs with delivery drivers at 2 am, simply so he can get honest feedback of what life is like making deliveries, and how they can make the process better. Most companies are not willing to commit to the customer in the way pretty much any Amazon employee is. dled by the customer service team.

Similarly, the local administration is fully equipped with digital technology and providing public services at a faster speed which is more transparent and accountable. Our young officials working at the grassroots are spearheading this digital public administration. In other words, the digital culture is on in full force in Bangladesh. n recent time by both the government and the central bank to monitor and evaluate their socio-economic impacts and help policy makers and regulators to make mid-term corrections, if needed. lobal trend of sustainable development related thoughts and practices. The whole world is keenly observing what is going on in Bangladesh, particularly in terms of its inclusive development innovations. It is indeed a challenging job for the social researchers to capture these fast moving changes to help policy makers adopt well informed development policies and monitoring the same for mid-term corrections, if needed. In this context, social researchers in Bangladesh are facing new challenges and at the same time getting equipped with new tools and techniques of research. These processes are to be documented and analysed not only for coming up with new directions for the country itself but also for the rest of the world so that others can follow our footsteps. ies vary between generations. Social researchers ought to focus on effects of varying access and adaptability to technologies. Digitisation of daily life is often linked to disintegration of social life as well. Another area that requires further attention of the social researchers in Bangladesh is to assess the social impact of this technological transformation.   e the long-term strategy to deal with this problem etc. This kind of research will help us in ‘protecting the gains’ we have been making in our socio-economic development, particularly by being digital. The digital technology is also not immune from misuse by the extremist groups. We have seen how some of our misguided youths were instrumental in creating an anarchic situation during Holy Artisan crisis period using digital technology. The society at large, however, rose to the occasion and fought it back unitedly. Yet, the social tensions surrounding undesired radicalisation are not fully contained and social researchers are well advised to keep their eyes open to monitor such social aberrations.  policies is either brushed aside or completely ignored. The corporate social responsibility for the greater good of the people and planet is still not the centre-piece of the on-going policy discourses. Yet, a global consensus is gradually emerging to deal with effects of climate change, to consume sustainably and to preserve the resources for future generations. This ethical push has come out of the global consensus on achieving SDGs and, in particular, the Paris Climate Agreement. Hence, there is a new moral compass for thinkers and doers all over the globe. Though a bit slowly, the focus from short-term growth potential and impacts is still moving towards long-term sustainability concerns. This paradigm shift and social life as a whole (all over the world) is being potently fuelled by dramatic changes in technology. We are indeed thick into digital culture which draws its strength from widespread adoption of digital technology.  researchers including students joined this conference from all around the country. While inaugurating this conference I shared my mind on the changing landscape of social research in a globalised and digitised era. Undoubtedly, we are now experiencing a strange but ever-changing global scenario. On the one hand, there is impetus to work together to attain the SDGs and to ‘leave no one behind’ while attaining those goals. On the other hand, in addition to the sharp increase in social inequality, there is a rising threat from protectionist measures and the trade war between the two giant economies (the US and China) which may constrain global public welfare. In the post global financial era, the BRICS countries have not taken up growth stewardship and more importantly, many experts are apprehending that another global financial crisis may be knocking at our door. The Bank of England has recently predicted that as high as eight per cent of British national income may fall due to BREXIT. The latest Presidential election in Brazil has created a space for rightwing upsurge and may erode most of the social gains made so far. riencing consistently six plus growth rate, the country is now being globally acclaimed as a role model for sustainable and inclusive development. It is now striving to realise bigger dreams such as attaining double digit GDP growth rate, complete eradication of poverty and hunger, and even becoming a high income country by 2041. The recent financial inclusion drive spearheaded by the central bank of the country (with potent support from the government) has virtually brought everyone under the broad umbrella of formal finance. Thanks to the mind-boggling growth of mobile financial services and agent banking millions of the financially disfranchised who never thought of going nearer to a bank branch are now doing regular financial transactions using their mobile sets. As a result, numerous windows of opportunities have now been opened for the country’s relatively young workforce including the disadvantaged groups. The empowerment of women has yet been another hallmark of Bangladesh success story. tributed to amending and/or formulating policies, providing evidence for advocacy campaigns, raising awareness at local and national levels, branding of the country, and even designing and implementing pro-poor programmes and projects.  a good time to try new things that will help us leap forward, and learn what works and what does not. During my tenure as the Governor of Bangladesh Bank, we followed this strategy and our efforts in the end resulted in some quite rewarding outcomes. In particular, we tried to learn by doing and corrected our policies after getting feedback from the grounds. Our researchers at Bangladesh Bank also changed gears and helped capture what was going on ground in the areas of financial inclusion, particularly in understanding the impacts of innovative programmes like mobile financial services, refinanced loans to the share-croppers and as well as to the women entrepreneurs.",3

According to the US Energy Information Administration, a federal body that collects energy-related information, there were 4,878 people in central Appalachia employed as surface miners in 2017, making it a modest, but not trivial, source of employment in one the poorest areas in the United States.[71]  will tolerate. Both responded that in 2012, the Corps began requiring a more rigorous process for issuing valley fill permits. Until that year, the Corps issued permits for valley fills under a national scheme, it most permissive standard that is supposed to be reserved only for activities with “minimal adverse impacts.” However, it now requires companies to apply for individual permits to construct surface mining-related valley fills, a process that includes evaluating each application as well as public notice and comments.[304] The letters are reproduced in full as an annex to this report.

The Obama administration promulgated several new rules that affect the coal industry. Some target practices that expose workers and others to immediate health risks, while others seek to reduce the industry’s contribution to climate change. This report focuses on the Stream Protection Rule, which required coal companies to monitor streams impacted by their activities for contamination and restore them at the end of a project.[48] The rule primarily targeted mountaintop removal, a form of surface mining that heavily pollutes nearby streams and evidence indicates exposes nearby communities to serious health risks.[49] The Obama administration also enacted a rule lowering workers’ permissible exposure to coal dust and expanding the monitoring of respiratory health to include surface miners.[50] est Virginia; National Mining Association (NMA); Ramboll Environs, a consulting company hired by the NMA to produce a study on the Stream Protection Rule’s impact; Dynamic Energy, a coal company with mountaintop removal operations; Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES), an academic initiative funded in part by coal companies; and a scientist who published a study funded by the coal industry.

In 1968, they formed the Black Lung Association along with miners and others, leading grassroots protests and massive strikes across Appalachia.[25] Even then, many industry representatives and government officials continued to deny the existence of the disease.[26] Activist pressure, however, ultimately prevailed and legislation protecting miners was finally passed in December 1969, further discussed below.[27]  alachian surface miners is that silica – present in the plumes of rock dust generated from blasting and excavating mountains – is more toxic than coal dust, and the combination of both may be more toxic than each individually. She noted that experts are beginning to call the disease Coal Mine Dust Lung Disease to capture this risk.[162] She also said that “drillers and blasters are at the highest risk” for CWP, an observation that comports with the heightened risk of rock dust.[163] samples showed high concentrations of particulates too small for the lungs to filter consisting of silica and coal dust as far as one mile from an active mountaintop removal site.[85] In multiple experiments, a team of West Virginia University researchers injected particulate matter from one of these sites into mice and human lung cells and concluded that the matter promoted tumor formation and cardiovascular disease.[86] In another indication of the toxicity of mountaintop removal dust, Appalachian surface miners are disproportionately diagnosed with black lung disease, including those who have never worked in underground mines.[87] Streams near mountaintop removal sites are contaminated with a range of heavy metals, including selenium, that have devastated their fish and insect populations.[88] Residents may be exposed to this contamination, particularly if they rely on well water, which is not regulated by the state or federal governments, leaving residents fully responsible for monitoring and treating for pollutants.  blackening the air to oil spills and industrial waste poisoning fish – brought public attention to the environmental degradation wrought by unregulated industry. At the same time, a steady drumbeat of ground-breaking studies began to link exposure to various toxins with serious health problems.[4] The nation’s sense of alarm went beyond air and water pollution as concerns began to emerge about synthetic chemicals and other hazardous substances that had become ubiquitous in consumer products, food, and workplaces.[5]  opposed the rule and stated – incorrectly – that the rule was ultimately canceled because it unlawfully duplicated existing rules and “would have provided no additional protections.” But many of the lawmakers in favor of eliminating the rule justified their decision based on the study it funded that improbably estimated that the rule’s implementation would end the vast majority of US coal production, a position that is at odds with the Association’s current claim that the rule largely duplicated other, existing protections. Regardless, not a single lawmaker who voted to repeal the rule even acknowledged the overwhelming scientific evidence indicating mountaintop removal’s threat to health. es, as well as in northeastern Tennessee.

Two years later, Congress overrode Nixon’s veto to pass the Clean Water Act, which placed restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into US waterways.[7] A third law passed in 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to ensure worker safety by limiting their exposure to hazardous substances. In addition to these wide-ranging laws, Congress passed numerous laws around this time to address specific pollutants that studies had shown posed risks to public health. ust grinding your throat,” he said.[158] While nearby communities are not exposed to the same concentration of dust as miners, and therefore are not susceptible to same types of diseases, the studies discussed in the previous section analyzing air quality near mountaintop removal sites indicate that residents may be chronically exposed to dust for years. ers to continue their work and nine days later they sealed the mine, leaving no hope for the trapped 78 miners. The mine had a long history of violating safety standards, including high levels of methane, poor ventilation, and excessive amounts of combustible coal dust that had already caused several fatal explosions.[33] In the months before the explosion, both federal and state inspectors who had visited the mine did not cite the company for violations, even though the fire boss charged with the mine’s safety recorded serious problems with its ventilation equipment.[34] cause their source water is often the same groundwater supply as private wells or surface water that is susceptible to MTR contamination. Many communities in central Appalachia rely on smaller municipal water systems, which tend to have higher levels of violations than systems that serve larger numbers of people—in part because these systems often fail to engage in proper monitoring.[231] Hendryx conducted a survey of all West Virginia water station’s violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act between 2001 and 2009 and found that counties with mountaintop removal had over five times the number of violations as counties with only underground mining even though they serve a similar number of residents.[232] The vast majority of these violations were for water systems’ failure to monitor water quality – a gap that suggests poor oversight by the state’s environmental agency. The study authors estimated that while it was not possible to know the extent to which they comply with safe drinking water standards, based on information they were able to analyze, there would likely be five times more health-based violations than in counties without mountaintop removal if properly monitored.[233] Jim Justice.[170] They lost the case, but 10 more families have sued and are awaiting trial.[171] Human Rights Watch spoke to seven families who live near Coal Mountain and all shared similar stories: they have lived in these homes all or most of their lives and had clear well water until it turned orange or black some time after the mining began.[172] Claims such as these –that coal mining has contaminated drinking water – are common in the coalfields of Appalachia and are not unique to mountaintop removal. Examples abound of people who believe their water – and health – has been harmed by coal mining.[173] The risk of coal processing chemicals polluting drinking water sources garnered attention in 2014 when around 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal, called MCHM (4-methylcyclohexanemethanol), spilled into the Elk River one mile upstream from a West Virginian drinking water intake for 300,000 people.[174] ating water quality standards and testing of well water or programs to monitor for mining-related contamination, so they could be unaware of contamination that is going untreated. Users of public water supplies may also be at risk, but there is often more source water protection for public supplies, the water is treated and its quality monitored before being delivered through a public system. ion alone. But it is hard not to see the coal industry’s substantial financial support of the lawmakers who oversee their activities as obviously relevant and deeply troubling.  ng activity within 100 feet of a stream; no exception can be made for activities that adversely affect the water quantity and quality or other environmental resources of the stream.[289] The rule was specifically designed to prevent mountaintop-removal valley fills, according to one of the rule’s authors, Jack Spadaro, who was a supervisor and field engineer in the Office of Surface Mining at the time. Spadaro later headed the Mining Safety and Health Academy from 1996 to 2004, a federal program that trains inspectors to enforce surface mining laws, and has since appeared as an expert witness in over 200 coal-related court cases. In his view, the rule categorically prohibits valley fills. “There are no surface mines that are in compliance with the law,” he said.[290]  Mountain, which has since been blasted for coal. Echoing many others, he told Human Rights Watch that at 27 years old he can already see the devastation of the streams. “We used to have freshwater mussels. That died out in my lifetime. We used to have hellbenders”—a giant salamander—""now they’re few and far between.”[180] ay nonetheless be adversely impacted by mountaintop mining pollution if not properly managed and monitored. Hendryx conducted a survey of public water treatment facilities in West Virginia from 2001-09 and found that mountaintop removal counties had over five times the number of Safe Drinking Water Act violations, principally for lack of monitoring, than in other Appalachian counties. Some facilities, particularly small ones, may find it difficult to monitor due to a lack of resources, but it nevertheless raises concerns that authorities and residents may be unaware that water contamination from mountaintop removal has negatively impacted both the source water for public systems and the water these systems then supply to users.  In another example of exploiting scientific uncertainty, a senior member of the National Coal Association argued that more research was necessary to determine safe dust exposure levels.[39] While miners and their allies were ultimately successful in getting the law passed, it demanded constant vigilance to ensure enforcement and protest efforts to weaken it.[40] The law’s black lung compensation requirement was particularly poorly implemented, leading to miner strikes and the Black Lung Benefits Act in 1973.[41] an Water Act and, since 1989, it has been responsible for issuing permits for mountaintop removal valley fills. The Clean Air Act, which is implemented and enforced by the EPA, may also be relevant to surface mining due to the dust it generates, but it has rarely been enforced in this way.

They cherrypicked this and manipulated that until they got the answer their paymaster requires.”[272] Lamm’s article states that “ARIES had no involvement” in the design or writing of the study, and his letter to Human Rights Watch he wrote that his “only contacts were with the staff of Virginia Polytechnical Institute.” He also noted that ARIES later contracted with his consulting firm to research additional studies, although he declined to provide the contract value. Both arrived at conclusions favored by the coal industry: One, published in 2016, concluded that the EPA “overpredicted” the lung cancer risk from low levels of arsenic in drinking water, and the second, published in 2018, found that the increased prevalence of fetuses small for their gestational age in mountaintop mining counties could be “primarily explained” by maternal tobacco use.[273]    of dust are visible when miners blast mountains – it once was so bad, Bradford says he reported it to his state Department of Environmental Protection – but recent scientific research indicates that the particulates filling the air at Edwight that are too small for the eye to see could be responsible for some of the health disparities in his area.   t she worries most about the cost of having to buy drinking water for the rest of her life. She has drinking water delivered in five-gallon jugs that cost $6 each, and uses one or two jugs a week, she said. She also buys $6 bags of salt each week to filter her well water for household uses. Even with the filter, she needs to regularly replace her clothes, pipes, faucet, washing machine, and anything else that comes into contact with water, because it stains, corrodes or otherwise ruins her belongings. She lives on a fixed monthly income of less than $1600 and “every little bit hurts,” she said. Rachel Belcher said that she tries to save money by filling up bottles at a spring around eight  miles away, but she often ends up purchasing water to save time. “It takes away from grocery bills and clothes for my granddaughter, who is still in school,” she said.[219]  Health and Human Services, a federal agency, from publishing a report on dangerously high levels of water contamination near military bases across the United States, citing a potential “public relations nightmare.”[256] In another foreboding development, according to a report published by the Washington Post in June 2018, the Interior Department promulgated new guidelines requiring US Geological Survey scientists to request permission before presenting research at academic conferences, and must show how the topic aligns with the department’s “priorities.”[257] better.[220] But perhaps the biggest cost is the steep decline in a property’s value. “If you try and sell it, who is going to buy it?” Jason said, when asked if his family ever considered moving. “I was raised in this hollow. My father, who was a miner, is buried right there,” he said, pointing to a small plot of graves behind his home. Sherry spoke about how much her husband loved mining. “I have nothing against coal mining. It’s my family’s trade; it’s our way of life. But if you damage someone’s property, take responsibility,” she said.[221] ive chemical and hydrologic alterations” cannot “be offset or reversed by currently required reclamation and mitigation practices.”[194] Moreover, many of the impacts on wildlife were found in the rivers into which these streams run, meaning that the pollution persists even when diluted with waters unimpacted by mining.[195] And according to the mining engineer Jack Spadaro, “once the groundwater is contaminated, it can take 400 to 500 years until it’s drinkable again.”[196]    d together with the Interior Department, which was under the direction of a former coal lobbyist, to change the Clean Water Act rules to allow coal companies to easily obtain permits to fill a valley with mountaintop removal overburden (known as valley fills), circumventing one of the legal problems the lawsuit identified. The agency later released a version of the environmental impact study that included no recommendations to limit mountaintop removal or address its toxic legacy. Instead of proposing limits on mountaintop removal, it proposed changing a surface mining rule to remove another legal obstacle to valley fills that the lawsuit raised. eted as the institution taking a position.”[259] The acting dean said he “thought WVU would be grateful” when he rushed to defend academic freedom at a public event following the incident, effectively quieting a storm criticism. But that was not his impression, he said, and his discomfort grew deeper when people connected with the university warned him that “my leadership position was in jeopardy” due to the research, he said. miology, 2014, pp. 405-411.    in which the regulatory agencies charged with protecting the water and air from mining pollution have approached the problem has shifted constantly over the past 35 years, shaped by countervailing political pressures and legal rulings. The two principle laws regulating mountaintop removal’s impact on streams are the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the 1970 Clean Water Act.[68] The decades-long struggle over the language, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws is addressed in detail in Chapter IV of this report. ii. ii elated with several types of cancer than county-level analyses.[123] Hendryx also conducted several studies based on door-to-door interviews that sought to more precisely measure mountaintop removal’s localized impact. A study based on interviews with 773 adults living in two rural areas of West Virginia found that those near mountaintop removal were significantly more likely to report having cancer.[124] Another based on interviews with 682 adults living in two rural areas of Virginia similarly found that those in the area near mountaintop removal had higher rates of respiratory symptoms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[125] A third, based on interviews with 952 adults in Eastern Kentucky, found self-reported rates of asthma and hypertension and other health problems was worse in the area near mountaintop removal.[126] And yet another found significantly higher levels of blood inflammation, a potential marker of cardiovascular disease, in 33 non-smoking, non-miner adults living near mountaintop removal sites than in 15 adults who did not live near mining.[127] mining or associated health risks. Respiratory, digestive, urinary, and breast cancer mortality rates increase in areas of central Appalachia with ecologically damaged streams, according to one study by a US Geological Survey biologist and Hendryx examining linkages between polluted streams and human cancer rates.[197] However, the study did not isolate exposure to contaminated water and whether it may cause health problems.[198] g there was in a county, the more frequently residents were hospitalized for respiratory problems – a correlation that disappeared when measured against total or underground coal production.[115] In Kentucky, researchers found two lung cancer clusters – the highest concentrations in the state – that overlap almost entirely with counties where mountaintop removal is prevalent; interestingly, they did not find elevated rates of lung cancer in areas of western Kentucky that are heavily strip mined but not through mountaintop removal.[116] rginia University’s School of Public Health who co-authored several studies related to mountaintop removal, cautioned that this may dilute mountaintop removal’s actual health impacts. “I would guess that if you got down even finer to the community level, the results would be even stronger for those adjacent to surface mines.”[122]   ology, 2017, p. 662-670. d Reclamation Act and Clean Water Act for decades.  decades, NIOSH recommended extending surveillance to surface miners.[159] In the 1980s, for example, NIOSH tests of dust samples from surface mines had shown dangerously high levels of quartz silica.[160] In 2014, the Obama administration extended surveillance to surface miners – a change the Trump administration is currently reviewing. The data collected under that program is not disaggregated by state, but the overall numbers indicate higher rates of CWP among surface miners than the previous ad hoc program had measured.[161] yTruth  be paying with their health: blasted rock fills the air with toxic dust and the valley fills contaminate streams with toxic metals. Over a dozen studies published in peer-reviewed journals show significantly higher levels of mortality, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and cancer in counties with mountaintop removal, compared to those with only underground mining or no mining at all, even when controlling for factors such as poverty and smoking.  a study examining children aged 11 to 13 who were exposed to drinking water with 241 parts per billion (ppb) of manganese exhibited adverse neurological effects compared to a control group of children matched for age, sex, grade, family income and parental education.[203] The EPA does not have mandatory limits on manganese in drinking water, but the US Centers for Disease Control lists exposure to manganese in dust or fumes as an occupational hazard that can damage the lung, liver, and kidneys.[204] The EPA also doesn’t set mandatory limits on iron, but an epidemiological study in Norway found that the relative risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease, “increased by 21 percent when iron content in the drinking water increased by 0.1 mg/L.”[205] y, simply asked mining operators how they believed they would be impacted.[285] With every incentive to exaggerate the impacts, nearly half said they would shut down, halting 90 percent of underground production and 75 percent of surface production.[286] Those assertions diverged wildly from the federally-funded regulatory impact analysis, which based its estimates on 13 representative “model” mines and found that the Stream Protection Rule would initially cost up to 590 coal production jobs, many of which would be offset by new jobs to ensure compliance with the rule.[287] That analysis also anticipated it would cost the industry $52 million to implement and decrease surface mining nationwide by one million tons annually.[288]  and Reclamation Enforcement, housed within the Department of Interior, is responsible for implementing the law. In enacting rules, it often relies on the scientific findings of the US Geological Survey, an agency within the Interior Department, or the National Academy of Sciences, an independent institute established by a law passed in 1863. All Appalachian states where mountaintop removal is present, except for Tennessee, have opted to enforce the law on their own.  captures the sheer amount of human tragedy buried in hard fought protections for workers, communities, and the environment that the government now seeks to eliminate. Sherry Walker, whose husband and father were coal miners and who sued a coal company that she believes contaminated her well, noted that supporting mining goes hand-in-hand with protecting miners and their families. “I have nothing against coal mining. It’s my family’s trade; it’s our way of life. But if you damage someone’s property, take responsibility,” she said.  who live near mountaintop mines disproportionately suffer and even die from a litany of health problems, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. A study conducted by West Virginia University researchers revealed that tiny dust particles released to the air in Edwight promoted cancer growth when injected into human lung cells, while another by the United States Geological Survey, a science agency within the Interior Department, found that nearby streams have lost half their species of fish.  As described below, miners’ strikes and protests across Appalachia were instrumental in securing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act in 1969, the first industry-wide set of regulations of its kind that predated even the Occupational Safety and Health Act.  pheric Particulate matter size distribution and concentration in West Virginia coal mining and non-mining areas,” Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 2014.     Reports, vol. 125, November/December 2011.  l Appalachia reveals that the more coal is mined from an Appalachian county, the poorer it tends to be – and counties where mountaintop mining is prevalent are among the poorest.[76] Remarkably, the data analyzed is from 2000 to 2007, the height of the mountaintop removal boom. Whereas average adult poverty rates ranged from 12.9 to 15.3 percent for non-mining Appalachian counties during those years, they were between a staggering 22.1 and 26.8 percent for counties with mountaintop removal and 17.7 and 21.3 percent for counties with other types of mining. McDowell County in West Virginia serves as striking example of how poverty and mining often go hand in hand: mining companies have excavated more than 140 million tons from this county since 1990, yet it has consistently ranked the poorest county in the state.[77] erior Department, at West Virginia’s request, funded the National Academy of Sciences to study the health impact of surface coal mining activities in central Appalachia and enacted the Stream Protection Rule, which required mining companies to monitor pollutants in streams near their activities and restore them at the end of the project. Both were promptly canceled under the Trump administration.   as well as other favorable studies it had funded. These studies have generally served to erode the appearance of scientific consensus. The narrative that no such consensus exists is then used by industry leaders as a powerful argument against regulation. A 2017 National Institute of Health review of scientific literature examining the health impact of mountaintop mining  found “[t]he only papers to report no adverse effects . . . had energy sector funding.”[274] Because they were not assessing the quality of individual studies, the conflicting research meant the review “could not reach conclusions on community health effects of” mountaintop removal, a point the National Mining Association highlighted in a letter to Human Rights Watch. However, the Association’s letter omitted that the review called for further study, and that the NAS study, which it opposed, would have assessed the quality of studies, enabling it to draw further conclusions.[275] But even the call for further study can be seen as a success from the industry’s perspective since that takes time – during which the status quo can continue.  ld Human Rights Watch they had the impression that the coal industry, which is a major university funder, put pressure on the university’s administration to end the research. While they said the university protected their academic freedom, in October 2011 the university’s public relations director wrote to the leading environmental journalist for West Virginia’s Charleston Gazette requesting that he refrain from using the term “WVU study” in order clarify “that the institution itself takes no position on the findings.” Coal companies also began to fund research, including a $15 million grant to Virginia Tech, a university, to establish a coal research institute; the grant produced the only studies that found mountaintop removal had no adverse health impacts. ient research into health effects of mining-related water contamination. However, his and others’ research indicates that even in cases where mining pollution consists only of metals that are not considered by the EPA to be unsafe, they may nonetheless pose health risks at extremely elevated levels, in combination with one another, or in children, older people, or those who have preexisting health problems. 018).   attended those meetings.[312] Moreover, the Office of Surface Mining’s director and deputy director both testified that Griles “was involved in numerous meetings and discussions regarding th[e] critical definition” of valley fills that would determine under which regime it would require permits.[313] In an unrelated incident in 2007 that exemplifies the potential corrupting influence of lobbyists, Griles pleaded guilty to lying to the Senate about using his position to assist the lobbyist Jack Abramoff in exchange for a $500,000 donation to an organization with which he was associated, and was sentenced to 10 months in prison.[314]   les/2016-06/documents/se_2016_fact_sheet_final.pdf (accessed October 19, 2018). ending.[278] Arch Coal’s heavy spending in favor of Republicans is in line with the coal mining industry in general: Open Secrets calculated that 97 percent of the $4.5 million the industry donated to candidates during the 2016 election cycle went to Republicans, including $265,000 to Donald Trump’s campaign.[279] (The industry spent an additional $9 million during the 2016 election cycle in so-called “soft money,” that goes to fundraising committees that can then transfer the money to political parties.) [236] As with black lung disease in the past, industry leaders have responded to the research with aggressive lobbying and research efforts aimed at discrediting the science and opposing regulatory oversight. These efforts aim not only at fending off new regulation, but also at challenging existing rules and at blocking new scientific research that could help establish those regulations’ necessity.  t two decades.[164] They offer several possible explanations: thinner coal seams and new types of mining that require cutting through more rock than in the past; advances in technology that crush rock into finer dust particles; and longer working hours.[165] In 2016, a new rule lowered workers’ permissible exposure to silica dust, adopting a recommendation NIOSH has been urging for years, but the Trump Administration delayed its implementation while the industry challenged it in court.[166] The court upheld the rule and on July 6, 2018, the Mining Safety and Health Administration began to solicit information to review the rule.[167] But what the scientific analysis of the air in mountaintop removal communities makes clear is that it’s not only miners whose health is at risk from the dust: people living near mountaintop removal breathe these tiny, toxic particles, too, likely at serious risk to their health. as more stringent regulations for fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.[136] In one study, over the course of nearly a year between 2011 and 2012, West Virginia University scientists took air samples from Edwight in Raleigh County and Twilight in Boone County, both residential areas near mountaintop removal in West Virginia, as well as third site in a nearby county without mining. The samples from Edwight and Twilight had a significantly higher mass of particulates, as well as higher concentrations between 0.01 and 0.4 micrograms, which are small enough to deposit or adhere to the lung’s surface.[137]   ouncil published a report based on data from 1995 that found that one out of every four Appalachians relied on well water – and as many as two in three people did in many of the counties where mountaintop mining is prevalent.[227] Human Rights Watch was unable to find more recent data. Residents reported a marked increase in connection to municipal water supplies over the last decade, but noted that some homes continue to rely on well water, especially those high in the mountains or in more rural counties.[228] Dr. Lafferty, who works as a general practitioner in a mountaintop removal area in West Virginia, said his office asks all children the source of their household water and estimated that 10 percent rely on well water. But West Virginia, like most American states, does not publish data on the number, location, or depth of private wells, nor does it regulate their water quality or advise against using private wells in any particular area.[229] A fact sheet on the website of the state’s Bureau of Public Health notes only that “private wells provide a clean, safe source of water to many citizens of West Virginia,” and that it is the responsibility of the well owner to “make sure that your water is safe to use.”[230]  hts Watch spoke in affected communities expressed a similar sentiment, as well as two doctors and three nurses who work in areas with high levels of mountaintop removal.[95] Most said they suspect mining-related environmental factors played a role, although they cautioned that this was based only on anecdotal observations. Dr. Wesley Lafferty, a family physician who works at Boone Memorial Health Clinic said, “Anecdotally, my goodness! We get all kinds of symptoms: rashes, restrictive airway disease [including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], dermatitis, generic skin disease. I definitely feel there is an environmental component to that.”[96] Dr. Lafferty also remarked that he has diagnosed “multiple” nonsmokers with lung cancer in the ten years he has been a doctor.[97] state’s Department of Environmental Protection to conduct a review and requested that the Obama administration support further research. In response, the Interior Department awarded a $1 million grant to the National Academy of Science (NAS) in 2016 to conduct a two-year study on the potential human health effects of surface coal mining operations in central Appalachia.[238] The findings of the NAS, an independent research agency founded by Abraham Lincoln to provide “independent, objective advice” to the government, are often a crucial step to enacting regulations. The NAS appointed an 11-member committee of volunteer experts, none of whom were “active members of the coal industry or any governmental agency that regulates coal mining.”[239] ng director of the Office of Surface Mining, that Kate MacGregor, a senior political appointee, has asked that he “follow up with you as DOI begins this review.” Less than two hours later, Owens wrote to MacGregor that she would call the NAS the next day to inform it of the agency’s decision – suggesting that they arrived at a decision almost immediately after the review began. On August 18, at 3:42 p.m., Owens sent the NAS the letter ordering it to halt the study. The Office of Inspector General investigated this decision at the request of Rep. Raúl Grijalva, the ranking member of the US House of Representatives Natural Resources Committee, who was concerned about political interference. The investigation concluded that “departmental officials were unable to provide specific criteria used for their determination” to allow or cease specific studies.[248]   e miners to safely disposing of coal ash. This report focuses on how Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act, a little-used law that gives it veto power over federal agency rules, to cancel the Stream Protection Rule, enacted after eight years of agency review, that required coal companies to monitor their impact on streams and restore them at the end of a mining project. The Trump administration subsequently canceled a half-completed federally-funded study the National Academy of Sciences was conducting on the potential health effects of surface mining in central Appalachia, even though dozens of scientific studies indicate that it poses serious threats to the health of nearby residents and destroys their environment. In doing so, the administration not only assured the continuation of a hazardous form of mining but also robbed the public of an important tool to assess its true cost.   patial Health, vol. 4:2, 2010, pp. 243-56.   for latent diseases to manifest themselves. This approach also risks turning scientific research into a battleground in the war over regulations since one of the ways that business interests can most effectively stymy regulations is by challenging, blocking, or controlling research to undermine achieving a scientific consensus.  n order to reach coal seams, miners clear a mountain of its trees and topsoil and drill holes deep in its surface in which they then detonate thousands of tons of explosives, blasting off up to 400 feet of vertical rock.[64] They then use 100-ton haul trucks to dispose of the loosened soil and rock, called overburden, by dumping it into the nearby valley, filling an area as much as 1,000 feet wide and one mile long and burying streams below.[65] According to the EPA, there were nearly 7,000 valley fills by 2005 and that number was expected to grow to bury 2,400 miles of stream by 2012, for a total distance longer than the Mississippi River.[66] Duke University scientists estimated that valley fills have severely damaged an additional 2,500 miles of streams by contaminating them with heavy metals.[67] ublished by West Virginia University researchers, and its funding research to challenge it, is further discussed in the following section. ty, and public health.

Since 1998, the industry spent nearly $200 million on lobbying and around $68 million supporting political campaigns, according to Open Secrets.[305] Like many other industries, its political spending skyrocketed in 2010 after the US Supreme Court held that limits on corporations’ contributions violate their free speech rights; the increase also skewed even more heavily in favor of the Republican party.[306] Open Secrets calculated that between 2010 and 2016, the coal industry spent $22.5 million backing Republican candidates compared to $2.5 million on Democrats.[307] tury, coal has dominated the economy of central Appalachia, an area made up of southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, the western edge of Virginia and northeastern tip of Tennessee.

He and other researchers have sought to address this problem by gauging disparities in the prevalence of specific diseases while controlling for covariates, as detailed below. They have found that cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, are particularly high among people living in Appalachian counties with mountaintop removal.[113] ng satellite imagery that was done by SkyTruth, Appalachian Voices, and Duke University.[59] A separate Appalachian Voices study, based on satellite imagery and mining permit data, found that by 2009, mountaintop removal had severely impacted or leveled more than 500 mountains.[60] These figures update the scarce publicly available government data on the extent of mountaintop removal. In 2002, the EPA calculated that permits approved in the prior decade allowed coal companies to mine around 1,600 square kilometers of forested mountain – roughly three to four percent of the Appalachian coal region.[61] A separate EPA-commissioned study found that few trees, or even shrubs, survive on the reclaimed mines, threatening 244 terrestrial species and eliminating a major source of carbon capture.[62] Although the amount of mountaintop removal has significantly declined over the past decade, it continues to produce millions of tons of coal per year, particularly in southern West Virginia.[63] ironmental factors, including iron in water.[217] Lending support to his concern, Jason said his symptoms “started around 10 years ago, I lost 90 pounds in three months.” At that time, he was still drinking water from his well. His health only began to improve, he said, in 2014, when the court ordered the coal company to provide an alternative water source to all the families who had sued while their case remained pending. But the coal company took back the water they had provided after the first group of 16 families lost their case, and he worries his health problems will worsen.[218]   alscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1005&context=jhdrp  at a Raleigh county clinic, April 27, 2018, Charleston, West Virginia; a nurse who works at an infusion center in Charleston, March 14, 2018, Raleigh County, West Virginia; a nurse who works in Boone and Raleigh counties, March 15, 2018, Fayette County, West Virginia.  ctivists because it did not ban mountaintop removal. Instead it required coal companies to monitor and restore streams impacted by their activities – an issue that most significantly affects mountaintop removal because of its reliance on valley fills that bury and contaminate streams. A government-funded assessment of the rule’s impact found it would cost $52 million to implement and ultimately cost several hundred jobs.   ng the National Mining Association suggested that inbreeding may be to blame.[262] In an op-ed published in the Charleston Gazette, a representative of the West Virginia Coal Association described the studies as “a classic example of prostitution of science in the service of a political agenda,” even though none of the research was funded by environmental groups or those opposing mountaintop removal.[263] He went on, oddly, to argue both that we cannot know what causes the health disparities because science “is never ‘settled’” and that individual choices such as tobacco use, diet, and lack of exercise are clearly to blame, without providing any evidence. This line of argument has been repeated by other industry representatives, including the National Mining Association.[264]       an avalanche of black slurry, residue from cleaning coal, down the mountain. The disaster killed 125 people and swept away hundreds of homes, bringing attention to the risks to nearby communities of mining.[43] The plight of these communities, which had been all but ignored, was further brought into focus by the rise in surface mining and its visible devastation of the environment.[44] 76/cuyahoga-fire/ (accessed October 19, 2018).   ly polluted by the practice. The US Geological Survey found that impacted streams “have less than half as many fish species and about a third as many fish as non-impacted streams,” and other studies similarly found adverse impacts on birds, insects, and even bacteria. Impacted streams’ conductivity – a unit often used as a proxy for pollution – frequently measures more than six times the level the Environmental Protection Agency identified as the limit for preserving their health.  mountaintop coal mining was prevalent in the coal producing counties in Appalachia, a mountainous region that stretches across 13 states in eastern United States. Since then, he and other researchers have published over a dozen peer-reviewed studies showing significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease, lung and other types of cancer, birth defects, and overall mortality, even after they controlled for factors such as poverty, smoking, obesity, education, race, and metropolitan setting. For example, one study Hendryx co-authored calculated an excess of 1,200 deaths in mountaintop removal counties annually since 1990, when the practice became prevalent, after adjusting for other factors, while another found that babies born between 1997-2003 had nearly double the chance of having circulatory or respiratory birth defects. t the particulate matter from the sites near Edwight was largely made up of silica, which was present at much lower levels in the matter from the non-mining site, and molybdenum, a metal that a Centers for Disease Control report links to “decreases in lung function” that was not at all present in the matter from the non-mining site.[138] Yet another study conducted by West Virginia University tested the air one mile of an active mountaintop removal site in Sundial, located near Edwight, and similarly found that particulate matter below 0.2 micrograms “dominate[d]” the air sample and contained high levels of silica and compounds consistent with coal dust.[139] lic Health at the time the research was ongoing told Human Rights Watch, “It was very clear that the WVU administration was getting feedback from industry which is a major funder.” In a separate interview, Hendryx said that although he was never directly pressured by West Virginia University to end his research, “I knew there was tension and that they were super concerned and nervous about it. Toward the end, if I had a meeting with journalists, someone from their media office sat in on it to keep an eye on me,” he said.[258] ats/centurystats/coalstats.asp  (accessed October 19, 2018). atalities: whereas on average 25 out of every 10,000 miners were killed annually from 1943 to 1947, that number dropped to an average of 15 over the next five years.[30] In 1952, Congress passed a new set of standards with limited enforcement power, but the average fatality rate largely held steady until Congress passed the first comprehensive legislation to protect coal miners in 1969.[31] howing elevated rates of birth defects in mountaintop removal counties.[269] Lamm reviewed the birth certificates on which Ahern relied and argued that one of the largest hospitals included in the study was overinclusive in how its doctors recorded birth defects. [270] On this basis, Lamm adjusted for hospital of birth, which all but erased the difference in birth defect rates between mining and non-mining communities. However, Lamm changed several parameters of the original analysis, including limiting it to West Virginia data, whereas Ahern had included all Appalachian counties, and removing 275 birth sites with less than a thousand births, leaving only 44 hospitals.[271]  moval sites provides evidence suggesting that mountaintop mining is not only associated with poor health but may cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. Air samples revealed high levels of inhalable particles consisting mostly of silica, a toxic heavy metal commonly found in rock dust. Researchers didn’t test for potentially hazardous inorganic substances, such as residue from explosives, chemicals used to process coal, and constant diesel emissions from massive trucks. Rather, they sought to gauge the danger to residents’ health by injecting the particles into mice and human lung cells. Multiple experiments showed that they promoted tumor growth and changed cellular function in ways consistent with cardiovascular disease. ler (accessed October 19, 2018).  igh. The images of the fire lighting up the heavily polluted river captivated the country, seeming to encapsulate the failure of a system that gave businesses virtually unfettered freedom to pollute the environment with impunity.[6] Public pressure jolted the government into action, and within two years Congress passed three landmark pieces of legislation that remain the pillars of the environmental regulatory framework in the United States. lica and coal dust may be even more toxic than each individually.[141] Moreover, Hendryx told Human Rights Watch that these studies may underestimate the toxicity of the particulate matter, since they did not test for organic compounds, which could include chemicals from explosives, the coal cleaning process, and diesel exhaust.[142]      good for workers and rural communities so well as the administration’s ongoing war on coal regulations. Parroting the industry’s claim of a war on coal, Donald Trump made deregulating coal a centerpiece of his campaign promise and, since becoming president, his administration’s policy agenda; voters in West Virginia, a state where coal has historically been central to the economy, elected Trump by a margin of more than 40 points, the highest of any state.[9] 1, p 51.  p.4 (accessed October 19, 2018). t health and other basic human rights. Where evidence indicates that corporate activities pose risks to public health or other human rights, the US federal and state governments have a duty to regulate these activities so as to effectively mitigate these risks. They should not eliminate existing regulations that serve to protect people from harm without putting in place effective alternative protections. aid they stopped drinking or cooking with the water from the contaminated wells, they continue to use it for bathing and brushing teeth (except the family whose well dried up). “What’s the difference between consuming it and breathing it?” one person asked rhetorically, referring to the water from steam in a bath or washing dishes.[216] Many also worried that they may have been drinking contaminated water for years after the mining began but before it turned orange from iron. Indeed, both arsenic and lead are colorless, tasteless, and odorless, and arsenic cannot be eliminated using conventional household filters.  The study, published in 2006, examined the long-term impact of water contamination and identified mines that had ceased to be active between 1985 and 1996; it did not specifically note the types of surface mines, but presumably the ones in southern West Virginia were predominantly mountaintop removal. The tests found levels of metals in the mined area such as manganese, barium, iron, and magnesium that in some cases were staggeringly high and well beyond both drinking water standards (applicable to public water supplies) and levels in a control group of wells in unmined areas.[224] 25 (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994); James Green, The Devil is Here in These Hills: West Virginia’s Coal Miners and Their Battle for Freedom (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2015); Thomas Andrews, Killing for Coal: America’s Deadliest Labor War (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2010); and Jeff Goodell, Big Coal: The Dirty Secret Behind America’s Energy Future (New York: Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006).  & Technology, 2014, p. 12913 and Cody E.

Governments may legitimately prune rules that are unnecessary or excessive, but the Trump administration’s speed, limited public consultations, devaluation of science, and close relationship with industries standing to benefit from deregulation have driven a reckless approach that threatens workers, public health, and the environment. w.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/GuidingPrinciplesBusinessHR_EN.pdf (accessed September 14, 2017). ese studies. the dust can be carcinogenic and cause cardiovascular disease.[146] These ailments have been found be more prevalent in counties where mountaintop removal occurs.[147] In one study, researchers exposed human lung cells and mice to the particulate matter from Edwight.[148] The exposure was equivalent to breathing the air at Edwight for 8.5 years. The study found that after three months of exposure, the lung cells showed significantly higher rates of cell growth and motility, which are carcinogenic properties of malignant cells, than those exposed to a control sample.[149] The mice showed similar results: after two weeks of exposure, they had higher tumor luminescence intensity than those injected with the control sample, “suggesting the tumor-promoting effect” of particulate matter near mountaintop removal sites.[150] know why,” Bradford said. Nicole C., who lives near a mountaintop removal mine in Wyoming County, West Virginia, told Human Rights Watch she constantly worries about the health effects of exposing her two young children, one of whom has Down syndrome, to the household’s contaminated water, which she believes is due to the mountaintop mine above her house. James C., her miner husband, and his father, a retired miner, were born in the valley, known as a hollow, and both said they had clear water until it turned bright orange from iron soon after mining began. “I’m worried about my babies. Is it safe to bathe them?” Nicole said. She said was also worried about the dust coming from the mine site. “If I kept my son’s toys on the porch, they’d become black. I couldn’t get the stuff off,” she said.   ines, is inconsistent with this duty. Similarly, the Trump administration’s decision to cancel a study assessing the potential health effects of surface mining operations in central Appalachia has denied residents information on risks to their health and created an obstacle for the government to better protect them from those risks. e coal industry backed, won the presidency.[293] In 2001, Bush appointed former coal industry executive and lobbyist Steven Griles as the deputy secretary of the Interior Department. Soon after, Griles, who had represented the National Mining Association as a lobbyist, made a speech to the West Virginia Coal Association promising to “fix the federal rules very soon on water and spoil placement.""[294] According to The Washington Post, he then ordered the draft report to be restructured to focus on “streamlining the permitting process,” leading to a final report, published in 2007, that made no recommendation to limit the size of valley fills. It proposed such superficial changes to the permitting process that one government scientist working on the project complained in an email to colleagues: ""All we have proposed is alternative locations to house the rubber stamp that issues the permits.”[295] The agency went a step further to protect mountaintop removal and, in 2008, changed the Stream Buffer Rule to allow waste near or within streams when there is no alternative.[296] untaintop removal. Rules under both laws include provisions protecting streams, a goal inherently at odds with a form of mining that depends on burying them. The regulatory history, described below, is a tug of war between the coal industry and people concerned by mountaintop removal’s health and environmental impacts fighting to exert influence over the government’s exercise of regulatory power.  ights Watch is unaware of any study that has examined the presence of chemicals from coal processing, diesel exhaust, explosives, and other mining-related activities, many of which are unregulated, in surface or groundwater near mountaintop removal mining activities.[211] documents/se_2016_fact_sheet_final.pdf (accessed October 19, 2018). llection on this issue is itself worrisome. Many people in these communities still rely on private wells, which are not subject to state or federal water standards or monitoring.

In 2002, the EPA calculated that permits approved in the prior decade allowed coal companies to mine around 1,600 square kilometers of forested mountain – roughly three to four percent of the Appalachian coal region.[61] A separate EPA-commissioned study found that few trees, or even shrubs, survive on the reclaimed mines, threatening 244 terrestrial species and eliminating a major source of carbon capture.[62] Although the amount of mountaintop removal has significantly declined over the past decade, it continues to produce millions of tons of coal per year, particularly in southern West Virginia.[63] ood, water and sanitation.

Spadaro later headed the Mining Safety and Health Academy from 1996 to 2004, a federal program that trains inspectors to enforce surface mining laws, and has since appeared as an expert witness in over 200 coal-related court cases.

The level of US coal production in 2017 was roughly the same as it was in 1980, yet the industry then employed five times the number of workers it does today.

Respiratory, digestive, urinary, and breast cancer mortality rates increase in areas of central Appalachia with ecologically damaged streams, according to one study by a US Geological Survey biologist and Hendryx examining linkages between polluted streams and human cancer rates.[197] However, the study did not isolate exposure to contaminated water and whether it may cause health problems.[198]   ntal Studies (ARIES). The initiative would fund researchers from eight universities, including West Virginia University, to study the human and ecological impact of coal. The catch: it was initially funded entirely by a $15 million grant from coal companies (it now also receives state funding).[265] ARIES’ website states that its research is “independent of the interests of its affiliates” and expect researchers to follow their respective universities’ research integrity policies.[266] In response to a letter from Human Rights Watch, published in full in an annex to this report, ARIES’ project director, Dr. Edmund Jong, clarified that industrial affiliates “would not have a role in selecting specific projects” for funding and they may not “dictate research methodology.” However, Jong did not respond to a query about whether the program’s corporate funders may communicate with researchers, a practice that is not only permitted but encouraged by the integrity policy at least one of the universities affiliated with ARIES.[267] Jong also noted that not all ARIES-funded research has been published, but did not specify whether funders had any influence over publication decisions. ctivists because it did not ban mountaintop removal. Instead it required coal companies to monitor and restore streams impacted by their activities – an issue that most significantly affects mountaintop removal because of its reliance on valley fills that bury and contaminate streams. A government-funded assessment of the rule’s impact found it would cost $52 million to implement and ultimately cost several hundred jobs. of health risks to workers, consumers, and communities. Governments may legitimately prune rules that are unnecessary or excessive, but the Trump administration’s speed, limited public consultations, devaluation of science, and close relationship with industries standing to benefit from deregulation have driven a reckless approach that threatens workers, public health, and the environment. nd Tennessee. Rather than hauling coal piece by piece through underground tunnels, they began to remove sections of the mountain to expose buried coal seams.[56] Within a decade, these surface mines became more ambitious, eventually removing hundreds of vertical feet of entire mountains to expose ever-larger areas of coal, a form of mining now known as mountaintop removal.[57] Official mining data does not generally disaggregate different types of surface mining, but according to Jack Spadaro, a mining engineer and mountaintop removal expert, the vast majority of surface mining in central Appalachia is mountaintop removal.[58] h operates mountaintop mines.[252] But the apparent speed of the Interior Department’s review process puts an event closer in timing to the decision in the spotlight: On August 3, West Virginia Governor Jim Justice switched from the Democratic to the Republican party at a rally hosted by Trump. A few days prior to the rally, Justice, who inherited a coal fortune and owns companies that operated mountaintop mines, said he had recently met privately with Trump “over and over and over” and discussed “boosting the coal industry,” according to media reports.[253] There is no record of that meeting and no way of knowing whether Justice raised the NAS study with Trump. At the time, 10 families who live near Coal Mountain had already filed a suit against his company alleging its mountaintop removal activities had contaminated their well water.[254] On August 1, two days before the rally, Trump had lunch with Interior Department Secretary Ryan Zinke and Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy Downey Magallenes, but there is no record of what they discussed.[255]  gering environmental and health impacts that have become increasingly clear over the last decade.

The study found that after three months of exposure, the lung cells showed significantly higher rates of cell growth and motility, which are carcinogenic properties of malignant cells, than those exposed to a control sample.[149] The mice showed similar results: after two weeks of exposure, they had higher tumor luminescence intensity than those injected with the control sample, “suggesting the tumor-promoting effect” of particulate matter near mountaintop removal sites.[150] erburden.

I couldn’t get the stuff off,” she said.[81] cause their source water is often the same groundwater supply as private wells or surface water that is susceptible to MTR contamination. Many communities in central Appalachia rely on smaller municipal water systems, which tend to have higher levels of violations than systems that serve larger numbers of people—in part because these systems often fail to engage in proper monitoring.[231] Hendryx conducted a survey of all West Virginia water station’s violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act between 2001 and 2009 and found that counties with mountaintop removal had over five times the number of violations as counties with only underground mining even though they serve a similar number of residents.[232] The vast majority of these violations were for water systems’ failure to monitor water quality – a gap that suggests poor oversight by the state’s environmental agency. The study authors estimated that while it was not possible to know the extent to which they comply with safe drinking water standards, based on information they were able to analyze, there would likely be five times more health-based violations than in counties without mountaintop removal if properly monitored.[233]  6788400bda94f4aa8d86.pdf (October 19, 2018).        d around a quarter of a million miners, the dangers of the coalfields were already well documented.[11] Scientific studies since have greatly refined Americans’ understanding of the health risks associated with mining, transporting, storing, and combusting coal. In recent years, these concerns have been amplified by greater awareness of coal’s contribution to climate change and the impacts of climate change on human health, including its potential to exacerbate some of the localized health risks of coal mining.[12] Still, mining, rail, and power companies profiting from coal continue to wage a more than century-old battle against rules protecting workers and communities from coal’s immediate harm to human health.[13]      mountaintop coal mining was prevalent in the coal producing counties in Appalachia, a mountainous region that stretches across 13 states in eastern United States. Since then, he and other researchers have published over a dozen peer-reviewed studies showing significantly higher rates of cardiovascular disease, lung and other types of cancer, birth defects, and overall mortality, even after they controlled for factors such as poverty, smoking, obesity, education, race, and metropolitan setting. For example, one study Hendryx co-authored calculated an excess of 1,200 deaths in mountaintop removal counties annually since 1990, when the practice became prevalent, after adjusting for other factors, while another found that babies born between 1997-2003 had nearly double the chance of having circulatory or respiratory birth defects. and concentration in West Virginia coal mining and non-mining areas,” Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology , 2014, p. 405, 9. The study did not find significantly higher levels of total suspended particles (TSP) in MTR sites, but did find significantly higher levels of ultrafine particles, defined as measuring below 0.1 microns in diameter, than in the reference site, including a higher percentage, number, and mass of particles able to be deposited in the respiratory tract.  blasting, drilling, or handling rock dust susceptible to the disease, including coal miners.[15] But as early as the 1830s, doctors began documenting coal miners coughing up black tar that eventually made them unable to breathe, symptoms distinct from silicosis.[16] In the following decades, doctors began to sound the alarm as they documented thousands of cases of miners suffering from what came to be known as black lung disease.[17] Yet the coal industry largely denied its existence, with some representatives even arguing that the black tar coating miners’ lungs was good for their health.[18] e early 1970s.[73] Between 1980 and 2015, coal mining productivity jumped from just under two tons per miner hour to over six tons; in 2015, productivity of surface mining was 11 tons per employee hour compared to 3.5 tons for underground mining.[74] Mountaintop removal is much less efficient than surface mining in western United States, but it is still less labor intensive than underground mining.[75] er detonating millions of pounds of explosives, trucks the size of his house dumped the loosened waste rock, called overburden, into the nearby valleys, burying the streams below. “It’s like a bomb hit,” Bradford said of the mountains he hiked since a child and where many of his loved ones are buried. an avalanche of black slurry, residue from cleaning coal, down the mountain. The disaster killed 125 people and swept away hundreds of homes, bringing attention to the risks to nearby communities of mining.[43] The plight of these communities, which had been all but ignored, was further brought into focus by the rise in surface mining and its visible devastation of the environment.[44]  e metals were found in wells near Coal Mountain, rendering the water unusable notwithstanding its health risks. Residents describe the costs associated with losing their water source as financially devastating, especially since they were already struggling to make ends meet.  a study examining children aged 11 to 13 who were exposed to drinking water with 241 parts per billion (ppb) of manganese exhibited adverse neurological effects compared to a control group of children matched for age, sex, grade, family income and parental education.[203] The EPA does not have mandatory limits on manganese in drinking water, but the US Centers for Disease Control lists exposure to manganese in dust or fumes as an occupational hazard that can damage the lung, liver, and kidneys.[204] The EPA also doesn’t set mandatory limits on iron, but an epidemiological study in Norway found that the relative risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn’s disease, “increased by 21 percent when iron content in the drinking water increased by 0.1 mg/L.”[205]   g regulations. In that case, the relevant federal agency oversees state governments to ensure they are adequately enforcing the law.       The study, published in 2006, examined the long-term impact of water contamination and identified mines that had ceased to be active between 1985 and 1996; it did not specifically note the types of surface mines, but presumably the ones in southern West Virginia were predominantly mountaintop removal. The tests found levels of metals in the mined area such as manganese, barium, iron, and magnesium that in some cases were staggeringly high and well beyond both drinking water standards (applicable to public water supplies) and levels in a control group of wells in unmined areas.[224] s of obtaining such a permit varies widely based on the kind of pollutant and its environmental impact. Despite mountaintop removal’s significant environmental impacts, including severely degrading the quality of streams, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issues permits for valley fills under a scheme reserved for activities with minimal adverse impacts. nted, he ordered changes to a report that was crucial in allowing large-scale valley fills to continue. Prior to his appointment, Griles had ownership interest in a lobbying firm that represented at least ten mining companies, including the National Mining Association and Arch Coal, which operates mountaintop mines.[310] In December 2004, Griles was forced to resign from his position after the inspector general found he had continued to meet with his former clients while in that position.[311] g there was in a county, the more frequently residents were hospitalized for respiratory problems – a correlation that disappeared when measured against total or underground coal production.[115] In Kentucky, researchers found two lung cancer clusters – the highest concentrations in the state – that overlap almost entirely with counties where mountaintop removal is prevalent; interestingly, they did not find elevated rates of lung cancer in areas of western Kentucky that are heavily strip mined but not through mountaintop removal.[116]   15, 2012, p. 432. ay nonetheless be adversely impacted by mountaintop mining pollution if not properly managed and monitored. Hendryx conducted a survey of public water treatment facilities in West Virginia from 2001-09 and found that mountaintop removal counties had over five times the number of Safe Drinking Water Act violations, principally for lack of monitoring, than in other Appalachian counties. Some facilities, particularly small ones, may find it difficult to monitor due to a lack of resources, but it nevertheless raises concerns that authorities and residents may be unaware that water contamination from mountaintop removal has negatively impacted both the source water for public systems and the water these systems then supply to users. els of conductivity, an indication of water’s ability to conduct electricity that is often used as an easily measured indicator of water quality because it is affected by the presence of heavy metals, salts, and other inorganic compounds.[187] The EPA identified 300 micro-Siemens per centimeter (µS/cm), a unit to measure electric conductivity, as the upper limit necessary to preserve the quality of Appalachian streams, but impacted streams measured several times this amount and often well above 2,000 µS/cm.

Two years later, Congress overrode Nixon’s veto to pass the Clean Water Act, which placed restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into US waterways.[7] A third law passed in 1970 established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to ensure worker safety by limiting their exposure to hazardous substances. In addition to these wide-ranging laws, Congress passed numerous laws around this time to address specific pollutants that studies had shown posed risks to public health. r contribute to human rights abuses.[337] The central pillar of these Principles is a requirement that companies carry out due diligence to identify the possible and actual human rights risks in their operations and lay out steps to prevent or mitigate those risks. In the context of mining operations that impact nearby communities or water supplies, that process should include good faith review of scientific evidence of the health impacts of their activities — and support for new, independent research where evidence is inconclusive. If a rights abuse did occur, then a coal company should endeavor to ensure that effective remedy is available to victims and participate in remediation.    842.   implementing the relevant laws to reflect technological and scientific changes. The Obama administration promulgated several new rules that affect the coal industry. Some target practices that expose workers and others to immediate health risks, while others seek to reduce the industry’s contribution to climate change. This report focuses on the Stream Protection Rule, which required coal companies to monitor streams impacted by their activities for contamination and restore them at the end of a project.[48] The rule primarily targeted mountaintop removal, a form of surface mining that heavily pollutes nearby streams and evidence indicates exposes nearby communities to serious health risks.[49] The Obama administration also enacted a rule lowering workers’ permissible exposure to coal dust and expanding the monitoring of respiratory health to include surface miners.[50]  d to these differences to argue Lamm had “monkeyed with the data” to please his funders. “It was nonsense. They cherrypicked this and manipulated that until they got the answer their paymaster requires.”[272] Lamm’s article states that “ARIES had no involvement” in the design or writing of the study, and his letter to Human Rights Watch he wrote that his “only contacts were with the staff of Virginia Polytechnical Institute.” He also noted that ARIES later contracted with his consulting firm to research additional studies, although he declined to provide the contract value. Both arrived at conclusions favored by the coal industry: One, published in 2016, concluded that the EPA “overpredicted” the lung cancer risk from low levels of arsenic in drinking water, and the second, published in 2018, found that the increased prevalence of fetuses small for their gestational age in mountaintop mining counties could be “primarily explained” by maternal tobacco use.[273]    captures the sheer amount of human tragedy buried in hard fought protections for workers, communities, and the environment that the government now seeks to eliminate. Sherry Walker, whose husband and father were coal miners and who sued a coal company that she believes contaminated her well, noted that supporting mining goes hand-in-hand with protecting miners and their families. “I have nothing against coal mining. It’s my family’s trade; it’s our way of life. But if you damage someone’s property, take responsibility,” she said.   blackening the air to oil spills and industrial waste poisoning fish – brought public attention to the environmental degradation wrought by unregulated industry. At the same time, a steady drumbeat of ground-breaking studies began to link exposure to various toxins with serious health problems.[4] The nation’s sense of alarm went beyond air and water pollution as concerns began to emerge about synthetic chemicals and other hazardous substances that had become ubiquitous in consumer products, food, and workplaces.[5]  to discredit the evidence and beat back any attempts at regulation. The industry had been fighting legal challenges to mountaintop removal since a group of West Virginians sued the federal and state government in 1998, claiming that the practice violated a surface mining rule that, according to its author, was specifically designed to counter the environmental impacts of mountaintop removal and that the government issued the industry permits through a process that violated rules under the Clean Water Act. ntatives and government officials who agree with them have even claimed that President Obama’s real goal was to put the industry out of business.[55] The Trump administration is currently in the process of weakening or doing away with virtually all these Obama-era rules. But while their rollback might help coal and power company executives, it is at the price of risking the health of their employees, nearby communities, and the environment on which we all depend.   lic Health at the time the research was ongoing told Human Rights Watch, “It was very clear that the WVU administration was getting feedback from industry which is a major funder.” In a separate interview, Hendryx said that although he was never directly pressured by West Virginia University to end his research, “I knew there was tension and that they were super concerned and nervous about it. Toward the end, if I had a meeting with journalists, someone from their media office sat in on it to keep an eye on me,” he said.[258] l West Virginians sued their state, and the federal government, claiming that these permits violated federal rules.[291] The government settled the claim by agreeing to conduct a comprehensive assessment of mountaintop removal’s environmental impact as a basis for a new regulatory approach.[292] But that study would fall prey to the same political pressures that had rendered existing rules meaningless. al and Public Health (2016) and Hamid Ferdosi et al., “Small-For-Gestational Age Prevalence Risk Factors in Central Appalachian States with Mountain-Top Mining,” International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health, 2018. eporting requirements, among other provisions to protect water quality and people’s health.[298] But the Corps of Engineers and EPA allow mining companies to avoid these requirements by categorizing mining overburden as “fill,” which falls under a much laxer permitting scheme than “discharge.”[299] The 1998 lawsuit arguing that mountaintop removal violated the Stream Buffer Rule also challenged this designation. At the time, the Army Corps’ guidelines defined “fill” as a material intended to replace “an aquatic area with dry land” – such as a dam or bridge – and explicitly excluded waste.[300] The court agreed with the plaintiffs and order the agency to require a NPDES permit for mining waste. However, that decision was overturned by an appeals court decision on the grounds that the case should have been brought in federal court. t health and other basic human rights. Where evidence indicates that corporate activities pose risks to public health or other human rights, the US federal and state governments have a duty to regulate these activities so as to effectively mitigate these risks. They should not eliminate existing regulations that serve to protect people from harm without putting in place effective alternative protections.  tury, coal has dominated the economy of central Appalachia, an area made up of southern West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, the western edge of Virginia and northeastern tip of Tennessee. . According to Sherry and Jason, the water started to become discolored around 2011 and over the years their 100-foot well slowly dried up so that today they have no choice but to bathe and wash their clothes and dishes in water pumped from the creek behind their house – a creek that they assume is polluted by the mountaintop coal mine, as well as from sewage piped directly into it by neighbors living upstream.[168] Jason said he’s saving up to contract the drilling of a new well, which costs $2,500, but there’s no guarantee that the water would be safe to use, especially since that is the price for a well around the same depth as the one that dried up. He had hoped to use a small bank loan for the well, but he needed the money to fix his mother’s roof. “I had to choose between a roof and a well. I’d rather have a roof over my head than water coming out of my faucet.”[169] Jim Justice.[170] They lost the case, but 10 more families have sued and are awaiting trial.[171] Human Rights Watch spoke to seven families who live near Coal Mountain and all shared similar stories: they have lived in these homes all or most of their lives and had clear well water until it turned orange or black some time after the mining began.[172] Claims such as these –that coal mining has contaminated drinking water – are common in the coalfields of Appalachia and are not unique to mountaintop removal. Examples abound of people who believe their water – and health – has been harmed by coal mining.[173] The risk of coal processing chemicals polluting drinking water sources garnered attention in 2014 when around 7,500 gallons of a chemical used to clean coal, called MCHM (4-methylcyclohexanemethanol), spilled into the Elk River one mile upstream from a West Virginian drinking water intake for 300,000 people.[174] an Water Act and, since 1989, it has been responsible for issuing permits for mountaintop removal valley fills. The Clean Air Act, which is implemented and enforced by the EPA, may also be relevant to surface mining due to the dust it generates, but it has rarely been enforced in this way.

These studies have generally served to erode the appearance of scientific consensus. The narrative that no such consensus exists is then used by industry leaders as a powerful argument against regulation. A 2017 National Institute of Health review of scientific literature examining the health impact of mountaintop mining  found “[t]he only papers to report no adverse effects . . . had energy sector funding.”[274] Because they were not assessing the quality of individual studies, the conflicting research meant the review “could not reach conclusions on community health effects of” mountaintop removal, a point the National Mining Association highlighted in a letter to Human Rights Watch. However, the Association’s letter omitted that the review called for further study, and that the NAS study, which it opposed, would have assessed the quality of studies, enabling it to draw further conclusions.[275] But even the call for further study can be seen as a success from the industry’s perspective since that takes time – during which the status quo can continue. est Virginia; National Mining Association (NMA); Ramboll Environs, a consulting company hired by the NMA to produce a study on the Stream Protection Rule’s impact; Dynamic Energy, a coal company with mountaintop removal operations; Appalachian Research Initiative for Environmental Science (ARIES), an academic initiative funded in part by coal companies; and a scientist who published a study funded by the coal industry. We received substantive responses from the Environmental Protection Agency; United States Army Corps; National Mining Association; ARIES; and the scientist, which are integrated into the report and included in full as an annex.    atalities: whereas on average 25 out of every 10,000 miners were killed annually from 1943 to 1947, that number dropped to an average of 15 over the next five years.[30] In 1952, Congress passed a new set of standards with limited enforcement power, but the average fatality rate largely held steady until Congress passed the first comprehensive legislation to protect coal miners in 1969.[31] cated. Not only did it allow the practice of mountaintop removal to continue, but it eliminated language in the preexisting rule, called the Stream Buffer Rule, that prohibited mining within 100 feet of a stream. But, as detailed in the following section, that rule had never been fully enforced and its replacement offered a compromise: in exchange for eliminating the buffer zone, it required mining companies to monitor and restore the water quality of streams impacted by their activities; established a more rigorous permitting process; and better protected ephemeral streams.[276]   untaintop removal. Rules under both laws include provisions protecting streams, a goal inherently at odds with a form of mining that depends on burying them. The regulatory history, described below, is a tug of war between the coal industry and people concerned by mountaintop removal’s health and environmental impacts fighting to exert influence over the government’s exercise of regulatory power. 1] While the overall mortality is striking, he noted to Human Rights Watch that one of the difficulties researchers face is that there is not just one distinct health problem associated with mountaintop removal.[112] Instead, communities, and individual residents, can be exposed to different activities and pollutants that translate into a wide range of health risks. He and other researchers have sought to address this problem by gauging disparities in the prevalence of specific diseases while controlling for covariates, as detailed below. They have found that cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, are particularly high among people living in Appalachian counties with mountaintop removal.[113] olds true even if serious risks have not been proven to the point of complete certainty. Because of the diffuse nature of many environmental harms and the long period of time it may take for health impacts to manifest, governments should take precautionary measures based on the best available science.  in which the regulatory agencies charged with protecting the water and air from mining pollution have approached the problem has shifted constantly over the past 35 years, shaped by countervailing political pressures and legal rulings. The two principle laws regulating mountaintop removal’s impact on streams are the 1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the 1970 Clean Water Act.[68] The decades-long struggle over the language, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws is addressed in detail in Chapter IV of this report. rchers produce all their emails, notes, drafts, data sets, and interview questions relating to several studies they published.[260] “FOIA has its place,” Hendryx told Human Rights Watch, “but this was excessive. It was obvious to me it was a way to harass me, make me waste my time.” The university’s attorneys defended Hendryx and the circuit court agreed the requests were unduly burdensome, although the West Virginia Supreme Court later ordered it to consider the mining company’s proposal to limit the FOIA request by applying an analysis under which “WVU’s document production obligations are dramatically reduced.”[261] The university has stopped researching the topic since Hendryx left the university in 2013, a decision he said was for personal reasons. Mountain, which has since been blasted for coal. Echoing many others, he told Human Rights Watch that at 27 years old he can already see the devastation of the streams. “We used to have freshwater mussels. That died out in my lifetime. We used to have hellbenders”—a giant salamander—""now they’re few and far between.”[180]  & Technology, 2014, p. 12914 and Travis L.

In 1968, they formed the Black Lung Association along with miners and others, leading grassroots protests and massive strikes across Appalachia.[25] Even then, many industry representatives and government officials continued to deny the existence of the disease.[26] Activist pressure, however, ultimately prevailed and legislation protecting miners was finally passed in December 1969, further discussed below.[27]  ist group opposed to mountaintop removal. An Environmental Protection Agency assessment calculated that mountaintop removal has buried more miles of stream than the entire length of the Mississippi River.  ment of private wells—federal water quality standards do not apply to them. As already noted, the risk of polluted streams contaminating groundwater increases in areas with a long history of underground mining, which is the case in nearly every county where mountaintop removal is prevalent. In fact, scientists who discovered lung cancer clusters in areas of Kentucky where mountaintop removal is prevalent suspected contaminated well water as a possible culprit.[222] rotect the environment.

The problem is that mountaintop removal severely contaminates streams.  moval sites provides evidence suggesting that mountaintop mining is not only associated with poor health but may cause cancer and cardiovascular disease. Air samples revealed high levels of inhalable particles consisting mostly of silica, a toxic heavy metal commonly found in rock dust. Researchers didn’t test for potentially hazardous inorganic substances, such as residue from explosives, chemicals used to process coal, and constant diesel emissions from massive trucks. Rather, they sought to gauge the danger to residents’ health by injecting the particles into mice and human lung cells. Multiple experiments showed that they promoted tumor growth and changed cellular function in ways consistent with cardiovascular disease. ouse of Representatives. On Feb 3, 2017, just two weeks after being sworn in, the new Congress canceled the Stream Protection Rule under the Congressional Review Act, a law that permits it to review rules issued by federal agencies within 60 legislative days after their enactment.[280] Congress had only used the law to overturn one rule before Trump came in to office, but has since used it to cancel sixteen rules.[281] The law prohibits agencies from reissuing the same or substantially similar rules to those that were annulled, meaning the Interior Department now has limited options to protect streams from mining pollution. It can, however, enact a rule that specifically addresses the environmental and health impacts of mountaintop removal, such as one that regulates air pollution or bans the practice entirely.   ers to continue their work and nine days later they sealed the mine, leaving no hope for the trapped 78 miners. The mine had a long history of violating safety standards, including high levels of methane, poor ventilation, and excessive amounts of combustible coal dust that had already caused several fatal explosions.[33] In the months before the explosion, both federal and state inspectors who had visited the mine did not cite the company for violations, even though the fire boss charged with the mine’s safety recorded serious problems with its ventilation equipment.[34] 11, https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/7-14-11_Lovett_RegAffairs_EPA_Testimony.pdf. cs, have been found after short-term exposure at concentrations as low as two parts per million (ppm).[208] The WHO recommends limiting exposure to an average of .11 ppm over a 24-hour period.[209] Simonton measured concentrations of as high as one ppm in the air of homes in central Appalachian mining communities with high levels of sulfates in their well water – and as high as 21 ppm in a shower stall with running water and 17 ppm over a kitchen sink when the faucet is running.[210]   as more stringent regulations for fine particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrograms.[136] In one study, over the course of nearly a year between 2011 and 2012, West Virginia University scientists took air samples from Edwight in Raleigh County and Twilight in Boone County, both residential areas near mountaintop removal in West Virginia, as well as third site in a nearby county without mining. The samples from Edwight and Twilight had a significantly higher mass of particulates, as well as higher concentrations between 0.01 and 0.4 micrograms, which are small enough to deposit or adhere to the lung’s surface.[137] elated with several types of cancer than county-level analyses.[123] Hendryx also conducted several studies based on door-to-door interviews that sought to more precisely measure mountaintop removal’s localized impact. A study based on interviews with 773 adults living in two rural areas of West Virginia found that those near mountaintop removal were significantly more likely to report having cancer.[124] Another based on interviews with 682 adults living in two rural areas of Virginia similarly found that those in the area near mountaintop removal had higher rates of respiratory symptoms and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.[125] A third, based on interviews with 952 adults in Eastern Kentucky, found self-reported rates of asthma and hypertension and other health problems was worse in the area near mountaintop removal.[126] And yet another found significantly higher levels of blood inflammation, a potential marker of cardiovascular disease, in 33 non-smoking, non-miner adults living near mountaintop removal sites than in 15 adults who did not live near mining.[127] ells. nd has a line of rocks running along its center, which replaces the stream buried beneath it. cts. The rule required mining companies to monitor and restore streams polluted by their activities, but Congress got rid of it in one of its first acts under the Trump administration.     ne 14, 2018, https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2018/06/14/scientists-at-usgs-face-new-scrutiny-on-research-presentations/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.4c23d6e18781 (October 19, 2018). tablish and maintain substantive environmental standards that are non-discriminatory, non-retrogressive and otherwise respect, protect and fulfill human rights. Of particular relevance to the concerns laid out in this report, he argued that while these standards should take into account the best available science, the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used to justify postponing effective and proportionate measures to prevent environmental harm, especially when there are threats of serious or irreversible damage. [329] erior Department, at West Virginia’s request, funded the National Academy of Sciences to study the health impact of surface coal mining activities in central Appalachia and enacted the Stream Protection Rule, which required mining companies to monitor pollutants in streams near their activities and restore them at the end of the project. Both were promptly canceled under the Trump administration.  aid they stopped drinking or cooking with the water from the contaminated wells, they continue to use it for bathing and brushing teeth (except the family whose well dried up). “What’s the difference between consuming it and breathing it?” one person asked rhetorically, referring to the water from steam in a bath or washing dishes.[216] Many also worried that they may have been drinking contaminated water for years after the mining began but before it turned orange from iron. Indeed, both arsenic and lead are colorless, tasteless, and odorless, and arsenic cannot be eliminated using conventional household filters. l Appalachia reveals that the more coal is mined from an Appalachian county, the poorer it tends to be – and counties where mountaintop mining is prevalent are among the poorest.[76] Remarkably, the data analyzed is from 2000 to 2007, the height of the mountaintop removal boom. Whereas average adult poverty rates ranged from 12.9 to 15.3 percent for non-mining Appalachian counties during those years, they were between a staggering 22.1 and 26.8 percent for counties with mountaintop removal and 17.7 and 21.3 percent for counties with other types of mining. McDowell County in West Virginia serves as striking example of how poverty and mining often go hand in hand: mining companies have excavated more than 140 million tons from this county since 1990, yet it has consistently ranked the poorest county in the state.[77] raclub.org/planet/2014/04/selenium-mountaintop-removal-coal-minings-toxic-legacy.html (accessed October 19, 2018). ights Watch is unaware of any study that has examined the presence of chemicals from coal processing, diesel exhaust, explosives, and other mining-related activities, many of which are unregulated, in surface or groundwater near mountaintop removal mining activities.[211] ient research into health effects of mining-related water contamination. However, his and others’ research indicates that even in cases where mining pollution consists only of metals that are not considered by the EPA to be unsafe, they may nonetheless pose health risks at extremely elevated levels, in combination with one another, or in children, older people, or those who have preexisting health problems. d Reclamation Act and Clean Water Act for decades. ublished by West Virginia University researchers, and its funding research to challenge it, is further discussed in the following section. . 295-302 alachian surface miners is that silica – present in the plumes of rock dust generated from blasting and excavating mountains – is more toxic than coal dust, and the combination of both may be more toxic than each individually. She noted that experts are beginning to call the disease Coal Mine Dust Lung Disease to capture this risk.[162] She also said that “drillers and blasters are at the highest risk” for CWP, an observation that comports with the heightened risk of rock dust.[163]  ion alone. But it is hard not to see the coal industry’s substantial financial support of the lawmakers who oversee their activities as obviously relevant and deeply troubling. ironmental factors, including iron in water.[217] Lending support to his concern, Jason said his symptoms “started around 10 years ago, I lost 90 pounds in three months.” At that time, he was still drinking water from his well. His health only began to improve, he said, in 2014, when the court ordered the coal company to provide an alternative water source to all the families who had sued while their case remained pending. But the coal company took back the water they had provided after the first group of 16 families lost their case, and he worries his health problems will worsen.[218]  will tolerate. Both responded that in 2012, the Corps began requiring a more rigorous process for issuing valley fill permits. Until that year, the Corps issued permits for valley fills under a national scheme, it most permissive standard that is supposed to be reserved only for activities with “minimal adverse impacts.” However, it now requires companies to apply for individual permits to construct surface mining-related valley fills, a process that includes evaluating each application as well as public notice and comments.[304] The letters are reproduced in full as an annex to this report. While this change is a positive step, neither the Corps nor the EPA explained the standard used for determining whether to grant the permit and how it meets the guidelines’ prohibition on discharge that would “significantly degrade” water quality.   t the particulate matter from the sites near Edwight was largely made up of silica, which was present at much lower levels in the matter from the non-mining site, and molybdenum, a metal that a Centers for Disease Control report links to “decreases in lung function” that was not at all present in the matter from the non-mining site.[138] Yet another study conducted by West Virginia University tested the air one mile of an active mountaintop removal site in Sundial, located near Edwight, and similarly found that particulate matter below 0.2 micrograms “dominate[d]” the air sample and contained high levels of silica and compounds consistent with coal dust.[139]  pheric Particulate matter size distribution and concentration in West Virginia coal mining and non-mining areas,” Journal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, 2014.  hts Watch spoke in affected communities expressed a similar sentiment, as well as two doctors and three nurses who work in areas with high levels of mountaintop removal.[95] Most said they suspect mining-related environmental factors played a role, although they cautioned that this was based only on anecdotal observations. Dr. Wesley Lafferty, a family physician who works at Boone Memorial Health Clinic said, “Anecdotally, my goodness! We get all kinds of symptoms: rashes, restrictive airway disease [including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease], dermatitis, generic skin disease. I definitely feel there is an environmental component to that.”[96] Dr. Lafferty also remarked that he has diagnosed “multiple” nonsmokers with lung cancer in the ten years he has been a doctor.[97] r 19, 2018). e that the first UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation specifically applied to the context of her mandate.[336] Since it is not a party to the Covenant, the US is not legally bound by that prohibition, but should nonetheless embrace it as a necessary component of any policy framework that aims to adequately protect the right to water. h 27, 2018, https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/implementation-national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-fine-particulate-matter. a period of fifty years, until the reforms of the New Deal, US senators and representatives from West Virginia “were generally either coal operators or men directly affiliated with the coal establishment.”[321] That close relationship remains true even today. West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice, is a billionaire who inherited his family’s coal fortune.[322] He briefly sold the business, which operated mountaintop removal mines, to a Russian company but bought it back in 2015 and turned its operations over to his son.[323] ng when considered against the vast sums spent by the industry on lobbying and campaign contributions. Since 1998, the industry spent nearly $200 million on lobbying and around $68 million supporting political campaigns, according to Open Secrets.[305] Like many other industries, its political spending skyrocketed in 2010 after the US Supreme Court held that limits on corporations’ contributions violate their free speech rights; the increase also skewed even more heavily in favor of the Republican party.[306] Open Secrets calculated that between 2010 and 2016, the coal industry spent $22.5 million backing Republican candidates compared to $2.5 million on Democrats.[307]  them to fill with dirt.

Regardless, not a single lawmaker who voted to repeal the rule even acknowledged the overwhelming scientific evidence indicating mountaintop removal’s threat to health.    epco, CSX Corporation, and Norfolk Southern. https://aries.energy.vt.edu/about0.html  Some of these companies were the principal mountaintop mine operators at the time.    ld Human Rights Watch they had the impression that the coal industry, which is a major university funder, put pressure on the university’s administration to end the research.

Almost every article I read seems to encourage personalized education, but I am left wondering if it is really possible when teaching a class of 30 or as many as five classes of 30 students per day?

Use information from the diagnostic assessment to group students, design instruction, and target students who may need extra help. tly, some assessments should mix skills that were acquired a while back with new skills so that the student retains previously taught information and can learn to apply the correct skill to a given problem. learning. Such questions are the cornerstone of personalization because they spark a dialogue that shifts the focus from the standards on a page to the student in front of the teacher.

When unions, as today, are as weak as they are now, that threat no longer exists. And with that loss of a threat, all workers are at the mercy of tight-fisted employers.  Bureau of Labor Statistics says that unemployment is down to just 3.9 percent, that agency is using a definition of unemployment which has been changed multiple times over the years, always in a direction of reducing that number from what it would have been under an earlier definition. Basically the BLS defines the unemployment rate as the number of people who want a job and cannot find one (that’s the numerator), divided by the number of people who are “in the labor force” (the denominator). But the BLS today restricts its definition of “in the labor force” to meaning just those who either have a job, or who may not have a job but looked for one at least once during the prior four weeks. Being employed meanwhile, is currently defined broadly as anyone who has worked as little as one hour during the week prior to the survey! One hour! rance program, are the main ones providing workers with health insurance, which workers lose if they are fired or leave the job (or go on strike), making it a powerful tool for serf-like domination. And the digital age means that a worker’s record, including any history of union activism, aggressive efforts to win higher pay or benefits, or taking legal action to defend what few rights an employee actually has, is all included on her or his file, making it hard for such outspoken workers to land a new job elsewhere. it that wages are not growing, and in fact, are lower in real dollars than they were in 1974, almost half a century ago. cally weakened over the past few decades by both political parties — primarily Republicans, who have been on a jihad to destroy unions, but also Democrats who have ranged from lackluster to treacherous in their lack of support for labor unions and worker organizing rights, workers, both unionized and not unionized, have been losing ground economically. yers took all the benefits of a restored economy for themselves — as they continue to do now in the wake of the Trump/Republican tax “reform” that was supposed to lead to higher wages as profits grew. markets are “tight,” meaning that there are few jobs available to unemployed workers, it should drive up wages of those who have jobs, because employers would have a hard time replacing workers who ask for more money. abor that one of his first acts on taking office would be to end all the totally legal delays employers have been able to avail themselves of to stall off, for years, a workplace vote by their employees on joining a union, and then if the workers win, to refuse to bargain in good faith for a first contract. He vowed to win passage for a new “card check” rule where once union organizers had received signed cards calling for a union representation vote from a majority of workers on a job location, a secret-ballot election supervised by the Labor Relations Board would have to be held there.

Absent a union contract, employment is “at will” on the part of the boss, who can fire anyone without cause, and the fired worker has no recourse. Prospective employers also can demand to know what prior employers paid an applicant, but an applicant for a job has know right to know what other workers on a job she or he is applying for get paid.  ty during his first term never put that bill up for a vote, either.

But it’s also playing offense, viewing intercontinental routes as a golden opportunity, given the liabilities of Air India and Jet Airways, and given the large pool of potential feeder traffic from its robust short-haul network. Thinking more boldly still, IndiGo would like to buy Air India, or its international franchise anyway, including its long-haul planes, routes and slots.

IndiGo has, however, already started applying for route rights to Europe, with London, Birmingham, Milan, Paris, Brussels, and Frankfurt all mentioned as possible routes.

Despite a slight recovery as the year draws to a close, it is still down around 10% against the US dollar in 2018. The currency will weaken further next year because of political uncertainty around the election and concerns about the independence of India’s central bank, analysts at Capital Economics wrote in a recent note. Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Turmoil at the top bank The darkest cloud on India’s economic horizon concerns its central bank, the Reserve Bank of India. Former central bank chief Urjit Patel stepped down abruptly in early December — nine months before his term was due to end. While Patel said he quit for personal reasons, his departure was preceded by a public spat between the central bank and Modi’s government. The government was reportedly pressuring the bank to do more to boost growth ahead of the election, and analysts told CNN that Patel was probably “no longer able to withstand” that pressure. Modi wasted no time in replacing Patel, appointing Shaktikanta Das, a former government finance official, as his successor barely 24 hours later. India’s hasty central bank appointment is a risky move Das’ hasty call-up and his government track record have sparked concerns that the central bank’s autonomy could be compromised. His appointment “is likely to keep investors and markets worried about RBI’s independence, given his close ties with the government,” said Priyanka Kishore, senior India economist at Oxford Economics. Kishore and other analysts predict the central bank, which hiked interest rates twice in 2018 and has held them steady since, will slash them in 2019. What happens next? Many of Modi’s proposed reforms, particularly to India’s land acquisition and labor laws, have not yet materialized. The major overhauls he has enacted, such as changes to the tax system and the cash ban, have been hugely disruptive to the economy. Next year’s elections could paint a different picture. “An election victory for Prime Minister Modi could provide space to re-energize his reform agenda after a lackluster 2018,” said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics. Modi could seek to cut red tape for business and further open India to foreign investment, Shah said. Another push to privatize state-owned firms is also likely. Other traditional pressures on the Indian economy, such as high oil prices, have eased in recent months. But as one of the world’s biggest energy importers, another spike could hit India hard. Whatever happens at the polls will h ctions in 2019: Growth slump India’s economy surged ahead in the first half of 2018 after spending much of the previous year recovering from a tax overhaul and a shock decision by Modi to ban most of the country’s cash.

I’m pleased to say that more and more education leaders and technology products providers are regularly talking and doing something about this. I hope this topic always remains the main problem to solve, and that the slow, steady progress the industry is making continues.   roadblocks. In 2019 and beyond, interoperability will be an extremely important point of emphasis for edtech leaders. At the end of the day, our role is to save educators time—not make their jobs more difficult.  Creating a learning community that nurtures emotional safety, connection, and inclusion provides fewer opportunities for the growth of the “outsider mentality” that often ends in violence, and will emerge as an essential tool for school security.  o include professional learning that recognizes the existing competencies and knowledge base individual educators bring to their work. Contributing to this trend is the growing use of data to encourage inquiry and dialogue in collaborative learning communities that build collective teacher efficacy. As such, we are going to see an increased focus on PD that facilitates assessment literacy, fosters active professional learning communities, and supports teachers in developing formative instructional practices. three phases. Student information systems and automated messages are what I consider to be the first stage in the evolution of parental engagement, or version 1.0. With the next stage, 2.0, came a myriad of apps, each designed to solve one problem really well. And now, I believe we are entering a new stage of “one-stop shop” solutions. As schools are adopting and using more digital tools, they are looking for solutions that not only consolidate functions to reduce the risks of privacy or security failure, avoid confusion among teachers and parents, and also better connect and engage school communities. We are already seeing the evidence of this, as administrators are taking a more active role in parent-teacher communication, ensuring that stakeholders are able to engage via their preferred method through one simple-to-use, safe platform. Additionally, educators swear that their parents are showing up more prepared for conferences and more in tune with their child’s education than ever before. As we gain further insight into teacher, parent, and student communication needs, interaction between school and home will become more commonplace and more frequent. ners. AR and VR can engage and excite learning while simultaneously breaking down traditional barriers of accessibility. Imagine a student experiencing the Louvre for the first time in an art appreciation course. dents and teachers are welcoming the re-emergence of meaningful interactions in the classroom. Consequently, technology will find its place to support rather than supplant student engagement through personal interactions with both peers and teachers.  e traditional thinking; however, there will be early adopters who will be willing to test new approaches—especially to help their most challenged learners. Data analytics embedded within instructional tools (not just digital renditions of content) will inform the process of change.   approaches and practices taught in Colleges of Education. Focusing on how students learn rather than what they learn will eventually lead to changes in conceptual frameworks of “teaching” and instructional practices. As this movement gains traction, formative assessment tools will become critically important to the iterative process of maximizing the learning environment and customizing instruction to meet students’ needs. oter Scores” (a measurement of customer experience) are more reliable and valid indicators of program excellence and student learning outcomes than standardized tests. lp educators individualize instruction—the ability to adapt and curate curriculum will be the new core curriculum. By better understanding what students know, educators will be better able to measure growth, predict performance, and make informed decisions about which curricular resources and instructional activities best fit the needs of their students. Soon the days of core, supplemental, and intervention will essentially merge as technology that gives educators the ability to curate the right curriculum for each student. impler data connections between systems. The only wrinkle I see in the land of interoperability is that the conversation is still too complicated, and school leaders still don’t have a go-to resource that helps them translate the techno-babble of open data standards into plain English. What the industry needs is a place where interoperability can be discussed and advocated without complicated jargon and a standards bias—maybe a “Church of Interoperability” that’s open to all. I see Project Unicorn possibly filling this role. They see the bigger picture and nicely bridge the tech and curriculum sides of the discussion. rnal growth and consistency required for adults to transfer SEL skills to students. As a result, greater value will be placed on SEL providers who bring longevity, proven results, practical tools, and adult-first approaches to the table. Recent years have brought about a surge of new SEL players, and many educators have scrambled to put new programs in place. Progressive leaders will emerge by acknowledging that successful SEL requires a perceptual shift from school leadership and staff, and also by discouraging midstream changes in favor of long-term personal growth. Educators will prioritize SEL over technology controls as cyberbullying deterrents. This more comprehensive understanding of social-emotional health will spur schools to prioritize SEL as a foundational response and technology monitoring as a complimentary (but secondary) facet of student wellness and safety. As a result, both physical bullying and cyberbullying will decrease in schools that prioritize meaningful connections, inclusion and emotional regulation.",3

This means employers cannot ban employees from openly discussing salaries with one another, but still gives employers the ability to protect confidential information of employees from their peers, such as salaries. Ultimately, the new law aims to create workplace environments where employees can talk about wage gaps and fight for employers to fix them. The new law also provides standards based on skill, responsibility, and effort to compare the work of two employees in the same role to determine appropriate salaries. contractors. Among other key aspects of the legislation, non-competes in Massachusetts may not exceed a maximum period of 12 months, but that period may be extended to up to two years if the employee breaches a fiduciary duty to the employer or misappropriates the employer’s property. All non-competes (for new or current employees) must be in writing, signed by both parties, and must expressly give the employee the right to consult an attorney before signing with specific advance notice requirements. The law also introduces so-called “garden leave,” which mandates payment to the employee during the non-compete period in the amount of at least 50% of the employee’s highest base salary during the prior two years, or other “mutually agreed upon consideration."" ncies and prohibits discrimination against employees on the basis of pregnancy or a condition related to pregnancy, including lactation or the need to express breast milk for a nursing child. The new law also requires Massachusetts employers to accommodate pregnant employees in the same manner they are required to accommodate employees with disabilities (e.g., through more frequent or longer paid or unpaid breaks, time off to attend to a pregnancy complication or recover from childbirth with or without pay, etc.). The law also contains a notice and disclosure requirement.  yees must consider how this will affect them in regards to workplace protocols and drug screening policies, particularly against federal laws that have yet to decriminalize the substance. Indeed, Massachusetts’ highest court (Barbuto v. Advantage Sales) recently held that the lawful use of medical marijuana may not automatically disqualify an applicant or employee from employment. Employers ought to review their personnel policies pertaining to drugs in the workplace and be cautious about their approach to pre-employment drug screening.    ",2

It's really hard in these cases though to know what exactly is going on. You know, if Facebook provides a staffer to a campaign, is that the same as providing a staffer to a corporation?

With the start of 2019, let’s have a look at the 10 sectors that need to upskill and reskill in the forthcoming year - e fourth industrial revolution, it is also experiencing major disruptions. Top banks across the world are shelling out billions of dollars to upgrade their systems, enhance security and improve digital banking or mobile banking experiences for today’s tech-savvy consumers. In fact, traditional banks are joining hands with fintech firms to cater to their customers the best way possible. With the fintech revolution taking the banking sector by storm and the changing nature of the workforce, upskilling is the need of the hour. According to Josh Bottomley, Global Head of Digital, Retail Banking and Wealth Management, HSBC, many roles and job titles of tomorrow are unknown to us today. He implies that banks in the near future will hunt for people with adaptability and an evolved skill set indispensable to these jobs.  are trained in a wide array of new-age skills. For instance, the demand for SEO professionals is on the rise since it’s becoming increasingly difficult to make a mark in the extremely crowded digital marketplace. Then come the data analytics experts, who utilise information in unparalleled ways to help ecommerce players better cater to the needs of their customers. In fact, data analytics will continue to remain one of the most sought-out skills in the sector. Looking at the huge impact made by AI in this sector, it’s only natural that companies require more people who are familiar with it and its applications. acturing plants for years now. It all began in the 1960s when the US started using robots in automotive factories. While those robots were only capable of simple, repetitive tasks, industrial robots have advanced at the speed of light over the last few years. This explains why the manufacturing industry has to upskill and reskill its workforce more than ever. In today’s age of automation, traditional blue-collar workers will need special skills to meet the requirements of future jobs. There is already a clear demand for professionals who are well-acquainted with new technologies like the computer-based design and 3D printing. n several factors including new technology, automation and upskilling of the workforce. To keep up with the changing times, then, the training ecosystem needs to shift from quantity to quality-driven training. Instead of having a broad overview, employees will require specialised training in supply chain management and operation skills.   hiring sectors in the country. Unfortunately, the existing workforce of this sector lacks in inventory management, customer service and soft skills. And, this can cause a possible decline in the wholesale industry in the near future. To avoid this, employees in the sector need to go through training that can help them build up the above-mentioned skills. ers. Not only have these advancements changed the experience for patients, but they have also made a significant impact on the lives of health professionals as well. The introduction of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), for example, has been a game changer in this industry by enabling easier sharing of patient information, enhancing patient care, improving public health and lowering treatment costs. Simultaneously, technologies like big data and cloud computing are also revolutionising the healthcare sector. Another major trend is the emergence of online health consultant platforms. Needless to say, the workforce requires upskilling and reskilling to match their abilities with these technological changes. According to the Telecom Sector Skill Council (TSSC), as many as 14.3 million employment opportunities will be created in telecom as well as telecom manufacturing over the next 5 years. While the numbers give a ray of hope, this industry is in dire need of quality professionals capable enough to work with new technologies and enhance their performance with greater efficiency. It’s no secret that many jobs in the telecom sector are already automated, which further stresses the fact that upskilling is indeed the need of the hour.   are now spending a huge amount of money on education technology. With the rise of digital learning tools and education apps, pedagogy is also constantly evolving. Standing at this point, the importance of upskilling the teachers can’t be stressed enough. Since they play a vital role in shaping our future generation, regular skill-enhancing programmes need to be organised for teaching professionals. he changing demands of customers. The major focus should be on the reskilling and upskilling of the workforce as new technologies such as AI, data analytics and machine learning will continue to rule the sector in the coming year. An Intel report reveals there will be a significant rise in AI spending by Indian IT companies over the next few months. Considering that the IT industry is directly impacted by technological advancements, it requires people who can’t be replaced by machines. Further upskilling is necessary to bridge the wide gap between the demand and supply of skilled talent in the IT/ITeS sector. tailers have already started taking measures to prepare for the changing times where technology and data sit at the heart of every operation. Along with the technological advancements, shifting customer expectations have made the need for upskilling and reskilling more important. Many companies are addressing this issue by training their employees with basic IT skills, which will prove to be indispensable for tomorrow’s jobs. At a time when online shopping is slowly becoming the new norm, it’s necessary for the retail industry to focus on upskilling its workforce.",2

Institutions can also make direct offerings, such as at the previously mentioned Make School, which provides a newly accredited applied computer science degree designed to take two to three years. This requires students to pay back 20 percent of their income for the first five years of employment, and if they don’t find a job, they aren’t responsible for payments. Institutions share the risk with the students, and in this particular program, are held accountable for student outcomes.  mis-matches. Watching these six trends and how they develop over time will be interesting. It is unlikely that they will reverse course anytime soon.  universities, as mentioned above, but also leverages its network of partners and its platform to help companies bridge their own tech-talent gaps in both hiring and training. One of the more successful models has been Pluralsight, which is an online platform for IT and software developer training. Its focused, industry-updated content, and close ties to employers are key success factors. A unique model to address this mismatch is Revature’s platform, which utilizes university partnerships and close collaboration with employers to deliver a program where students pay their tuition over a two-year period after they are employed. ing the need for change at universities. The mismatch in employer needs and employee skills is leaving over seven million jobs unfilled in the U.S.  public universities like Arizona State University to elite private institutions like MIT to the many relatively new education companies entering the sector like Make School, Coursera, and Trilogy Education.	 orld, three are particularly noteworthy for influencing recent innovation: reduced return on investment for students, reduced government spending, and significant skills mis-matches between graduates’ abilities and jobs available. out it. An important element in understanding the return on investment of higher education is the cost of the degree. ased cost of higher education, online programs are offering not just increased flexibility, but also a major reduction in cost. Coursera offers a fully online master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in computer and information technology for one-third the cost of the on-campus version. Several programs are also allowing students to “test” degrees by taking courses that can eventually be “stacked” into a degree, thus lowering their risk. MIT now offers a supply chain management degree with a portion of the curriculum online through edX before students enter the on-campus program. Arizona State University allows students to take the first year online as part of the Global Freshman Academy. In both programs, students complete a portion of the degree online and then apply for the on-campus, full degree at a fraction of the price. odel, the university provides the content, while the OPM primarily puts it online and leads the marketing efforts. The leader in this market is 2U, which, for example, partners with the University of North Carolina to deliver an online master’s degree in public health. Another smaller but fast-growing player in this market, which according to Eduventures, is expected to reach $2.5 billion by 2020, is Coursera, which works with the University of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and HEC Paris, among others. Companies like Trilogy Education partner with top universities to deliver in-person skills training on-campus in fields such as coding and cybersecurity. Other companies like Orbis Education partner with universities to help bridge the healthcare provider shortage through a hybrid approach to pre-licensure healthcare programs, while ExecOnline partners with top business schools to deliver executive leadership courses online. middle-income countries like Brazil and Chile. In the U.S., tuition prices have skyrocketed and the cost of an undergraduate degree is 13 times higher than it was 40 years ago. Tuition and fees have increased over 1,000 percent since the late 1970s and the increase in the cost of food and housing was less than a third of that.  ber of internationally mobile students is expected to increase from 4.5 million in 2015 to nearly seven million in 2030. International students are increasingly attractive to universities, as they allow expanded reach and programs offered at different price points. Students from China, India, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea account for more than 50 percent of students who go abroad to earn their degree, with China as the largest source. The U.S. has seen a recent decline in its growth of international students, which some link to stricter immigration policies, but student flows are expected to increase globally. Pathway programs, which are a small but fast-growing segment of the transnational education market, help foreign students get admission into U.S. institutions through bridging academic entry standards. Companies such as the U.K.-based Study Group and U.S.-based Shorelight partner with universities to set up these programs and use revenue share models, providing an additional revenue source for universities. Most of these programs are in countries that have been traditional draws for higher education like the U.S., but some are now also in countries like China that traditionally send many students overseas. t students. In the U.S., for example, states cut funding deeply after the recession hit—spending 16 percent less per student in 2018 than in 2008. Universities are responding with cost cuts and seeking alternative revenue sources. For example, Purdue University has reduced its in-state student intake by approximately 4,000 over the last ten years—while increasing its out-of-state and international student intake by about 5,000—as these students pay higher tuition largely without the need of financial aid.   f students—either through workplace training, outside reading, or purely life experience—happen to have the competence and knowledge required for a particular subject, they can take the test and get credit without having to take a class. Title IV funding (financial aid) is available for some of these programs, which includes the University of Wisconsin and Southern New Hampshire University, a sign that the U.S. Department of Education recognizes their importance. In previous discussions, the global strategy company Parthenon estimated that more than 600 institutions are either exploring or have launched CBE programs, with double-digit growth expected annually from 2013 to 2020. It is too early to predict the efficacy of these programs, but their popularity with students and employers continues to rise. ortage. Of the job openings mentioned, 1.2 million or 17 percent are in the healthcare sector, highlighting a continued shortage of nurses in the U.S. According to a recent study by McKinsey, this sector is the only one in which “the need for physical and manual skills will grow in the years leading to 2030.” and chief of staff to the CEO at Laureate Education, a B Corp and the largest international network of degree-granting higher education institutions.

This skills mis-match is particularly acute in fields like computer science where real-world practice easily outpaces academic curricula. By 2020, one million computer science-related jobs will go unfilled, and many computer science programs at universities are outdated. In the words of one Make School college student attending its innovative tech program after taking computer science classes from the elite public university where he received a B.A., “my university courses taught me all about the theory of computer science, but I couldn’t actually code.”",2

The most healthy-looking stem cells in that tissue were isolated and encouraged to multiply, and the revved-up results then sprayed back into the lung.

He is working on a similar approach to kidney disease, but so far only in mice. rging ahead. It has not been a beacon for scientists elsewhere. And far from benefiting from a culture of free inquiry, Chinese science takes place under the beady eye of a Communist Party and government which want the fruits of science but are not always comfortable about the untrammelled flow of information and the spirit of doubt and critical scepticism from which they normally grow. time it is not at all surprising that the He affair took place in China. It was a perversion of what Chinese scientists are trying to achieve as they seek to establish themselves and their country in the world of elite science. But it was also an illustration of it. the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC), one of the country’s main funding bodies, has been running a campaign against such misconduct. Wei Yang, until recently the NNSFC’s boss, describes a situation in which, to stop interference from outside, the composition of interview panels is kept secret until the last minute. Panellists are not told in advance who candidates are, and both panellists and candidates have their mobile phones confiscated in order to avoid anyone being nobbled—which used to happen even while interviews were being conducted. ened a translational-medicine centre in Shanghai, where laboratory researchers, clinicians and patients will all be under the same roof and biotech companies encouraged to set up shop next door.

Making use of it has cost billions more. Nor would China be able to supply all the physicists needed to make use of such a facility. Like the LHC, the next accelerator will be a single lab for the world, wherever it is: these toys are one-per-planet affairs. But the Chinese seem more serious than anyone else about hosting and building the thing. Just as it meant something beyond the world of particle physics when America cancelled its proposed giant SSC and CERN’s LHC became the biggest game in town, so it would mean something if China took CERN’s crown. biology led by independent academic researchers has drifted too far from potential medical application. In America, in particular, biomedical-research prowess and the health of the population are increasingly poorly correlated. rm, a bigger space station, assembled in orbit from modules launched separately, and in the longer term crewed missions to the Moon enabled by a new booster more powerful than any of today’s, the Long March 9. hat is both enjoined and keen to tackle juicy topics. A study published by Elsevier, a scientific publisher, and Nikkei, a Japanese news business, on January 6th found that China published more high-impact research papers than America did in 23 out of 30 hot research fields with clear technological applications.

Vanadium-flow batteries are of interest because, unlike most batteries, in which a single electrolyte is built into the cell, a flow battery has two electrolytes and an open cell through which they pass. This means its storage capacity is governed solely by the size of the tanks that store the electrolytes. That makes it possible, in theory, to build batteries big enough to store energy on a scale useful to large grids. The theory has been developed by Zhang Huamin, a researcher at the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, a local arm of CAS. The factory in Zhuanghe, owned by Dalian Rongke Power, a local electricity company, is trying to turn theory into practice. If it works, it could revolutionise grid-scale electricity storage.  economy, but the geopolitical sway and military might to match, soft power of all sorts, a storied past and a glorious future. Science is a big part of this. It is seen in China, as elsewhere, as an ennobling pursuit and a necessary foundation for technological advance. China’s leaders see such advances as crucial not just to their economy, but also to expanded military prowess and social progress. They want the sort of science that will help China project its power and respond to its people’s particular problems. They want new clean-energy sources and freedom from resource constraints. And the country’s ever greater scientific proficiency makes such ambitions look realisable. It is a long way from landing on the Moon to mining it.

In some labs and institutions in China things doubtless do work that way. But the authoritarian system in which they are embedded makes it hard for Chinese science to speak truth to power, or escape challenges to its integrity. This gnaws at the scientific body politic, and saps resources, both financial and moral. ze of a room to the size of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which occupies a 27km loop of tunnel beneath the Franco-Swiss border at CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory.

China has imported ideas and approaches more than people and ideals. The resultant set-up has the ricketiness often seen in structures ordained from the top down rather than built from the bottom up.  in part because of the sheer size and expense of its tools. But there are other parts of physics with more of the cutting edge about them. These include applications of the more abstruse aspects of quantum mechanics to computation and cryptography, an area where China is a world leader: it was the first country to send a quantum-encrypted message via a satellite. In computer science, too, it has few peers. Though it does not yet have a semiconductor industry that quite matches those elsewhere, it is world class in many applications, especially in artificial intelligence. nd its researchers imaginative, progress may come swiftly.

Fudan is one of them, as are Tsinghua and Peking Universities and Dr He’s alma mater, USTC. The other is the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), an official agency that runs laboratories of its own, which will adhere to prevailing international standards.

Those reactors are of similar design to the plants already in operation around the world. But China is also exploring new reactor technologies—or rather, technologies abandoned elsewhere.

Today, however, observers both inside and outside America’s higher education establishment have begun to ask whether a system more than two centuries old is the best fit for an economy whose skills and demands change at the pace of modern technology.  apprenticeships. They also need to come up with ways to certify skills that workers acquire on the job, and participate in efforts to develop new systems to upgrade workers’ skills and retrain displaced workers.  to upgrade the education of workers in a rapidly changing economy, and reskilling workers for career transitions. That’s a whole new mission—one that educators and employers alike are still struggling to understand and embrace. It’s the role of the federal government, working group members said, to provide the data and analytics that participants need to understand those problems, to facilitate a national policy discussion, to improve financial incentives to make it easier for educators and employers to provide the opportunities workers need, and provide the resources workers need to seize them.  n jobs created since the Great Recession, 12 million required a bachelor’s degree or higher. And that imbalance is likely to continue: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 68 percent of all jobs created from 2016 to 2026 will require post-secondary education; about 40 percent will require a B.A. at minimum. Fewer than 12 percent will require only a high school diploma or less. B.A. first if they want to learn to write computer code or enter another profession that requires a defined set of skills. Students need to make decisions about what kind of degree or major to pursue with little information about what jobs will be open two, four or more years into the future. The high costs contribute to the difficulty of many students completing their education, which leaves a significant portion of them in the worst of both worlds: saddled with debt, but with no degree to show for it.  four-year degree programs over other options. Working group participants said that while the government must be careful to make sure the education it supports leads to good outcomes for students—primarily jobs—it should loosen the rules so that students can get financial aid to pay for job-related training that may not include a B.A. “The federal government is the only source of liquidity in the system, and they tightly restrict what you can do with that money,” said one participant, “particularly for learners outside those prime educational years.” ant disadvantage to make individual choices about where high-value propositions are for training and reskilling.”  or a new career. More thinking needs to go into so-called stackable and modular courses and credentials that can combine skills and knowledge learned in a variety of institutions. The new systems should incorporate innovations like online learning, which would expand access to higher education economically and geographically. Finally, without eroding their commitment to traditional four-year bachelor’s degrees, colleges and universities, particularly public institutions, need to move students’ job-training goals closer to the center of their mission.   ational options, so they can assess what courses and credentials will pay off in the long run.  nd upgrade their skills. Employers may worry, reasonably, that their investment in training could backfire if employees quit and take their new skills to a competitor. To move forward from this impasse, some working group members suggested developing a new federally sponsored system in which employers, workers and the federal government would pay into some kind of training account that workers could tap into throughout their careers. Because contributions would be broad-based, individual employers wouldn’t suffer from asymmetrical losses if employees moved on. For workers, owning the account means they’d have the freedom to reskill to get a new job or even switch professions as the economy shifts.  finance more specialized training that might be more job-focused or to help older workers upgrade their skills or make a career transition later in life. Congress and the federal government should consider allowing federal loans to be used to pay for shorter-term training as well as traditional degrees, simplify the loan application process, and develop assessment tools to help potential students better evaluate job prospects for various programs and providers.  ligence are becoming a part of more workplaces, shifting the roles for human workers, and increasing the need for not just high-skilled workers, but constant skill upgrades. n faster than wages. More than 40 percent of students who start college fail to graduate, often ending up with debt but no degree to help them pay it off. Those who do graduate don’t necessarily have an easy pathway into the white-collar middle class. Meanwhile, the millions of older Americans who need to improve their skills midcareer face an education system whose incentives and federal policies are still built around the idea that “higher education” means high school graduates seeking bachelor’s degrees.    on about credentials and degrees coming from institutions, workers should have some kind of “lifetime transcript” following them from one job to another that contains information about education and training from a variety of institutions. Those institutions could include community colleges, specialty training institutes and employers.   tution may not be recognized at another institution, forcing the student to repeat or simply lose that credit. Instead, if a student could accumulate credits and credentials over the course of their lives, they could add up to degrees or credentials that enhance their résumés. “Stacking” credentials in this way would help students who drop out of degree programs get credit for what they have already learned and make it easier for midcareer workers to pick up where they left off. It also would make it possible for a worker to attend a variety of institutions, from traditional universities to specialty institutes to online schools, and even integrate those credentials with training from an employer. “We need to break up that traditional linear pathway of [the] four-year degree,” said one participant, in favor of “stackable, modular education.” inkage between education and jobs. Group members disagreed about how promising some of these ideas are, but generally agreed that they deserve more study and attention from federal policymakers.  ericans will find themselves moving back and forth between school and work … or working while studying, or studying while working. The higher education system currently focuses on young adults leaving high school; going forward, working group members said the system needs to expand its concept of who is a student and what is a university. “It’s going to be very important to make sure that we come up with a system that works in terms of reskilling people, not just at the large firms that have workforce planning, but throughout the economy,” said one participant.  e approach to financial support could open doors for people at more points in their lives, and also incentivize new types of institutions, such as online education providers, built around training and “upskilling.” And a potential new and expanded area for the government lies in its role as a trusted repository of information. In the future, Washington could build and promote a new system for credential-sharing and data-gathering that could replace today’s strict reliance on degrees with a new menu of qualifications adaptable and portable enough to change with a fast-moving economy of the future. And over the long term, Washington could consider supporting a new system for financing career-related education that workers could tap into as needed throughout their lives.  that’s not even considering the growing demand for professional credentials. Already, one-quarter of American workers need some kind of license or certificate to do their jobs, and the bureau predicts that percentage will continue to climb.  e Washington could play in that change. The group met under Chatham House rules to encourage candor.  education is the envy of the world in many respects, it’s not fundamentally well-suited to meet the needs of workers who now need retraining or “upskilling” at later points in their careers. Older workers who want or need to upgrade their education or switch professions have little information about what jobs are in demand and what training is necessary to qualify for them. They may also not be comfortable in a traditional classroom and may lack the financial means to pay out of pocket. And federal financial aid programs, similarly, are shaped by this older model; they generally don’t pay for education that isn’t focused on traditional degree programs.  rlong journalism series called the Future of Prosperity, exploring the long-term challenges facing Americans’ financial well-being.  spond well to hands-on learning outside the classroom. This is particularly the case for midcareer workers who don’t want to go back to school and who are psychologically invested in working. “We need to think very seriously about the value of work to the individual ... One of the biggest problems with unemployment is that you actually become, in many ways, disenfranchised as a citizen,” said one participant. “We’ve got to meet them where they are and figure out how to get them the skills that they need as worker-learners through a different model,” said another.  rees but varied job prospects, depending on their major. Older workers, particularly those who are unemployed, have little guidance or resources for getting back into the workforce. Working group participants cited statistics indicating 1 in 7 prime-age men in the United States isn’t in the workforce as evidence that the system needs disruption.  sed by employers less as a qualification than as a signal—a document that proves a graduate is capable of learning. If employers want to better match workers to jobs, some participants said, they need to think more seriously about exactly what skills they really need, and which of those skills can be taught on the job and communicate that more clearly to potential applicants. “Right now, the degree is the coin of the realm, but many people believe that there will be a transition more to [hiring for] skills,” one participant said.  ecure retirement. That is no longer the case, and the working group identified several changes that are shaping the new reality. sidents of both parties have supported apprenticeship programs, but they have yet to catch on – there are only 500,000 apprentices in the United States, compared with 17 million college undergraduates. One idea for making apprenticeships more popular is to connect them to higher education and allow apprentices to earn college credit during their on-the-job training.

Employers, too, need a mechanism for evaluating degrees and qualifications, as well as exchanging ideas and information about policies and programs.  to identify problems than chart policy solutions—in part because of today’s political crosscurrents, and also because of the limited set of tools available at the federal level.

Inspirata will be delivering a presentation introducing digital pathology as a vehicle for both new diagnostic innovation and alleviating pressure on over-stretched laboratories.Held annually since its inception in 2002 and organised by the Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine (ACB), FiLM will again bring together leading domestic and international figures from pathology and diagnostics to discuss how they can further contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes.  Front-of-mind for many in attendance will be how they can embrace innovation and proven best practice while simultaneously navigate the perennial challenge of staff shortages.  The 2018 Histopathology Workforce Studyi produced by the UK Royal College of Pathologists revealed just 3% of NHS laboratories currently possess sufficient staff to meet demand.  However, the issue of recruitment and retention is not unique to the UK and constitutes a global predicament.  Inspirata’s invitation to attend FiLM reflects the key role many feel digital pathology now has to play in a profession characterised by such limited human resources.“It is an unfortunate coincidence that some of the greatest developments in diagnostic innovation should emerge at precisely the point in which clinical laboratories the world-over are wrestling with a chronic lack of personnel to take advantage,” says Inspirata Founder Dr. Mark Lloyd.  “The silver-lining is that effective implementation of digital pathology, whereby emphasis is placed on an intelligent workflow, enables hospitals to reconcile staff shortages with their appetite to tap the opportunities provided by the very latest digital diagnostic tools.”Inspirata’s involvement in FiLM 2019 marks the one-year anniversary of the company’s acquisition of Dynamyx™ from GE Healthcare and the setup of European offices.  The momentum towards digital pathology which has transpired since their arrival is a development not lost on the Inspirata team.  “The conversation has fundamentally shifted,” explains Mark. “When we setup in the UK, the dialogue enjoyed with institutions entertaining digital was cloaked in conditional terms.  ‘If’ opposed to ‘when’.  Fast-forward to today and we see a complete reversal.  We have seemingly reached a tipping-point in favor of digital and the sense of excitement for what it means for patients is palpable”.   Further reinforcing this perception that the tide is shifting firmly away from analogue is the announcement of several large NHS tender processes for digital pathology in 2019",3

And, of course, proliferation allegations against Huawei’s CFO linked to the company’s Skycom investment, leading to her arrest in Canada. Huawei has pledged to spend $2 billion addressing British concerns. But multiple countries are now escalating their security measures against Chinese technologies. rds a year ago when Huawei was essentially baked into the plans. Speaking to reporters, Jeremy Wright, the British secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, stressed that it’s “important to say this is not a Huawei specific exercise,” albeit it’s basically exactly that. A more formal statement from his department said that “we will need to consider the most appropriate mechanisms for demonstrating the outcomes of the review once it concludes in the Spring."" national security interests by vulnerabilities in the telecommunications supply chain… China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes.”   nd U.S. political and economic influence.

And last year it announced its intention to build a security and surveillance division to compete with the likes of Axis, Hikvision and Dahua, with the goal of being a top three player within a small number of years. ringing criminal charges against telecommunications giant Huawei and its associates for nearly two dozen alleged crimes… To the detriment of American ingenuity, Huawei continually disregarded the laws of the United States in the hopes of gaining an unfair economic advantage.”  lance industry, it added in the dimension of national security. Going after ZTE and Hikvision and Dahua and Hytera is one thing. But then everyone waited with bated breath to see if Huawei, the veritable gorilla in the cage, would be dragged into the mix as well. ts UK graduates in China and described Huawei as “one the most innovative companies in the world, supporting innovation in the UK.” He also encouraged “UK companies, UK entrepreneurs and UK students to visit China to build mutual understanding of our respective cultures and economies.” And yet, by the end of 2018, the BT (and more recent Vodafone) shifts away from their equipment were making headlines as Huawei’s two flagship UK customers turned a crisis into a disaster for the company. inantly in the three-headed space race of Cloud, IoT and AI that is set to drive revolutionary change across every industry, every economy, and it has become the world leader in the 5G networks that will underpin all of this.

Any 5G rollout delays stemming from the Huawei backlash will be a major setback for carriers, and the impact will be even greater if enforced or self-selected prohibitions on Huawei equipment extend from the network infrastructure to the radio technology out in the field. There is also, in the minds of the carriers, a risk of creating a Nokia/Ericsson duopoly without Huawei in play to provide some level of balance. Huawei customers have backtracked, whilst the government also looks set to change direction away from their equipment. And now the European Union could be about to do the same.

The country has vacillated on China and telecoms network infrastructure over the last year, as previous tensions between the world’s two most populous countries diminish. If Huawei is removed from India’s plans, that could be the most damaging outcome of all from the U.S. campaign against the company.  badly damaged Huawei has been by the last few months. Liang Hua denied that his company would “install backdoors in devices or networks in order to collect information for the intelligence organization.” And he said that his company would ""never do anything to harm any country, any organization or any individual.” The headline-grabbing news this week that the FBI conducted a sting operation in the U.S., whilst investigating further allegations of spying against Huawei, has not helped him make his case. n. And at the heart of the argument is a very simple hypothesis aimed at the country’s leading exporters: you wouldn’t be where you are today without the support of the state, so how can we believe you would never yield to the influence of the state when pushed? And, ultimately, it’s this tortuous ‘proving of a negative’ that has caught Huawei so firmly and unexpectedly on the backfoot. ld the rest of the world to avoid Chinese equipment in general, and Huawei in particular, as 5G is deployed over the next few years.

By October, President Xi had designated AI, big data, and the Internet as the trifecta that would transform China into an advanced economy. In a decisive span of a few months, the government had set in motion a new vision of the future. For Lee, “the government’s AI plan was like President John F.

This is where China has a decisive advantage in deepening the economic impact of AI: the enormous customer bases for Chinese services mean that the tech sector has more data to use for machine learning, and therefore its algorithms become “smarter” faster.  emerges, the ideological trappings of a new Cold War could pit rival geopolitical blocs against each other while isolating Chinese and American tech sectors from each other, which would paradoxically starve US innovation of the Chinese market it depends heavily on for profits and technical talent.

In 2017, Chinese AI start-ups attracted more venture capital than their US rivals did, and PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that, by 2030, China will add $7 trillion to its GDP as a result of AI deployment. If these trends continue, China’s techno-authoritarianism is poised to win the AI arms race — the stakes of which are enormous. the US retains its competitive advantage in knowledge-intensive fields, accounting for around 30 percent of global R&D investment and over 45 percent of patents granted.  y of clamping down on China’s intellectual property theft misses the scope of a crucial future challenge facing US hegemony: the acceleration of Chinese artificial intelligence.

That protection provides that large employers (defined as any company or organization that has an average of at least 50 full-time employees) are not offering health coverage if they fail to offer to its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan. Thus, the assertion is that by allowing large employer treatment for otherwise small employers, but not requiring these entities to meet the coverage requirements, there is created a new plan outside of the ACA limitations and requirements. e resolved ultimately on cross-motions for summary judgment, it is likely the case will not be resolved at the District Court level for 6-9 months. with a grant of authority to implement ERISA, as the effort here is to make a change to the definition of AHPs, to which Congress itself has repeatedly objected. [It is worth noting that similar types of arguments were made by 29 States seeking to prevent prior Obama Administration efforts in a variety of other fields, for example in regulatory efforts affecting the coal industry.] Finally, plaintiffs’ claim that the consideration of the Final Rule failed to appropriately consider the history of abuse in the era of AHPs or other multiple employer welfare plans (MEWAs) which were not subject to stringent oversight by many states as such plans oftentimes claimed, incorrectly, that ERISA pre-empted state regulation.  manipulation of [ERISA]” to shift a larger number of small employers into the large group insurance market, “because the ACA’s core protections do not apply to that market.” From plaintiffs’ perspective, the new AHPs created under the Final Rule would lack the incentives and protections provided under the existing ERISA framework, which would result in less coverage and destabilizing impact on both the individual and small group markets. As plaintiffs see it, “the Final Rule would return the country to the pre-ACA world where people with pre-existing conditions will lack federal protections that enable …quality, affordable health insurance.”  stion is whether to move forward with the investment required for creation and investment in this vehicle. That analysis should be based not just on a view of the likelihood of success of the Federal Court challenge, but also of the likelihood that the state of residence of a new AHP will have the necessary enabling legislation. That is a state by state analysis, and at this point it appears that at least New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Pennsylvania have indicated that they will not allow the creation of AHPs for the sole purpose of buying insurance through the large group market. ition of an employer and the other elements of the Final Rule designed to expand insurance opportunities for small employers, including sole proprietorships had been opposed by a variety of interests, including the Attorneys General of a number of States, some of whom promised litigation to stop the implementation of the Final Rule prior to the potential effective date of September 1, 2018 for fully insured AHPs. stantive relationships other than the sale of insurance, to meet the necessary test.",2

Automation is not the only way to deal with skills shortages (immigration and later retirement also help) but it is one of the most important. wider social acceptance. Companies may not be able to automate their way out of future skills shortages. Other responses, such as raising wages, attracting more women into paid work and allowing more migration, will be just as important. Last, there may be room for the expansion of global supply chains, as work shifts from ageing China and other middle-income countries, to Africa and poorer places with more labour. Ageing demands a robotics revolution but it may be slow to arrive. loneliness and mitigate the effects of dementia. They will make it easier to look after people in nursing homes and enable older workers who want to stay employed to keep up with the physical demands of labour. These robots will also be fundamentally different from industrial ones, which usually replace human activity—fitting a car windscreen, for example. By contrast, service robots extend it. For example, if an exoskeleton helps someone lift something heavy, the person still has to be there. ith relatively few robots compared with the size of their workforce include Britain and France, both of which (by rich-country standards) are ageing slowly. o surpass humans in certain kinds of information- processing, notably pattern recognition which (within limits) robots can perform more quickly and reliably than humans.

Wages there also tend to be low, making automation unprofitable. But ageing creates demand for automation in two ways. First, to prevent output falling as more people retire, machines are necessary to substitute for those who have left the workforce or to enable ageing workers to continue to do physical labour. Second, once people have retired they create markets for new kinds of automation, including robots that help with the medical and other requirements of caring for people who can no longer look after themselves.  that invested the most in robotics were those that were ageing the fastest—measured as a rise in the ratio of people over 56 compared with those aged 26-55. The authors posit a rule of thumb: a ten-point rise in their ageing ratio is associated with 0.9 extra robots per thousand workers. the number of robots per thousand workers rises twice as fast as the fall in the growth rate of the population (ie, if population growth falls by 1%, the growth in robot density rises by 2%).

Reflecting on her difficulties in locating a public toilet during an emergency situation, she advocated for the importance of public databases to help people locate public toilets and highlighted this issue as a gender-based sanitation problem. This realisation spearheaded into the Toilet Mapping Initiative. This is what happens when a workforce is diverse--issues often overlooked come to the fore.

She also learned to factor in the users’ perspective while creating websites to make them useful and appealing --which she says has been very worthwhile in her journey in the world of technology. The country has also seen the emergence of other local initiatives such as MakerKT, Miss Tech among others. Such initiatives are important in engaging women in technology from a younger age-- when it is easier for them to overcome biases and conditioned difficulties.

  it offered specialised ICTs skill development training to civil society organisations in different local governments in the country. The participation of women in such trainings has seen an increase and participants such as Apsara Karki, Executive Director of SOCH Nepal, mentioned that after the training by KLL, she felt empowered. However, there is still a long way to go before women feel self-reliant in solving technological challenges. One way to remedy this is to start early by encouraging girls in schools to not look at the field of Information technology as an insurmountable problem. This is more important now as research suggests that gender stereotypes about children’s’ own intellect emerge at an early age--which is a precondition for the decisions they make about their career. WLiT and Kathmandu Living Labs has also worked on this, by developing programs to train high school girls on community mapping and making them familiar with open geographic data.
 e civil society can advocate for equitable distribution of resources to overcome all forms of the digital divide—economic, social, gender-based and so on. Organisations can also learn from initiatives of governments to distribute technological tools to women and college students, as seen in India. While the sustainability of such initiatives is questionable, these are excellent transitional interventions that can accelerate social changes. This is even more important because research done in 2018 found that women in low-and middle-income countries are, on average, 10 percent less likely to own a mobile phone than men, which translates into 184 million fewer women owning mobile phones. More alarmingly, even when women own mobile phones, there is a significant gender gap in the usage of services such as mobile internet.

 ts of the world, tasks such as taking care of children and ailing family members, and carrying out domestic chores are seen as the primary domains of women. While challenging these dominant narratives and realities requires deeper structural changes, ICTs can enable women to become independent in the meantime--financially and otherwise--by ensuring that they can work remotely and with flexible working hours.

Lawmakers wanted that opportunity this week. Instead, the embattled leader has again sought to delay proceedings as she battles to guarantee a supportive majority in the House of Commons.Officials in Brussels, and businesses on both sides of the English Channel, have been quick to express their dismay at her decision, as a ""no deal"" deadline looms ever closer. And after a visit last week with a logistics firm that has recently opened a new fulfilment center in Southampton, thanks in part to the Brexit-related uncertainty about Britain's future trading relationship, it is possible to understand the context for that apparent frustration.

But he says it is only the larger businesses that can afford to devote time and money to this kind of no-deal planning.The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) says its members have continued to hold off on this kind of spending, and says many would need between six weeks and two months to get ready for a no-deal Brexit.

It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes.  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $100,000 plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a 20% basis year-over-year. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base.  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY20, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q4, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. s. What does that equal for the full-year billings gross ex that developer fee? adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities. our years, we've been adding additional value-added products like data governance, our platform capabilities, advanced security capabilities, add-on solutions around the core. What we're finding is as we're moving more toward solutions selling larger transactions, we want to get out of the mode of selling each individual product on a one-off basis to customers and really being able to bring the full suite of Box's cloud content management platform to our customers. da start of the whole context of the overall strategy from an IT standpoint looked very different given the prior relationship structure. We had a number of use cases, some higher value than others. Unfortunately, in some of the high-value ones with this new leadership in place there ended up being a cost versus value gap that we couldn't bridge with the new leadership. ting gross margin throughout FY20 to range from 70-71%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-70s. Q4 was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 64.6 million representing 39% of revenue, a significant improvement from 51% in the prior year, which includes a roughly 3% benefit related to the adoption of ASC 606. Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts.  well. Other parts of performance in FY19 as well as expectations for FY20. To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY20 is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history. And due to the increasing success of our add-on products, we'll be making it much easier for our customers to adopt the full power of our cloud content management platform by launching new product suites in the first half of FY20.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about 300 quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that. y driven by the strategic nature of these transactions and we're working to make sure that they can happen as smoothly as possible. And that we're constantly improving our own internal processes to drive these as well as the sales rigor and the operational rigor to make sure that we can get these across the finish line. I think the 100k deal segment and the 500k deal segments did show very healthy growth on a year-over-year basis. And as a note, the miss in the seven-figure deal translates through both the 500k and the 100k deal segments because it's a cumulative number.  years, you've grown quota carrying headcount well in excess of revenue growth and certainly in excess of billings growth. You would think if the solution sale selling is working, it would certainly be evident in your fiscal fourth quarter where these solution-based large deals really accumulate and seasonally are strong. s a little bit higher than in most quarters by the really strong growth that we saw in Japan that we mentioned as virtually all of those deals are through the channel. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $10 million. -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $163.7 million in Q4 up 20% year-over-year with 23% of Q4's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed 94 deals over $100,000 versus 79 a year ago, 12 deals over $500,000, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $1 million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $237.7 million representing 16% calculated and 17% adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-20s. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $40 billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY20, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. s but in that seven-figure category, we were not happy about those results. We are seeing those seven-figure deals in both our Q1 and Q2 pipeline. So, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get the majority of those things closed throughout the next couple of quarters into Q3. And we'll see the details show up. t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q1 billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY19, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q1 to Q3 representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q1 billings. As such, Q1 will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q1 billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY20. ry and our prior expectations were based around those numbers. I would also just say that certainly, there are gonna be other factors and a lot of puts and takes in the business that relate to and have an impact on FY20 growth.  hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into?  management with new metadata solutions and Box platform updates. And three, advanced security classification and thread detection with Box shield. From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks. the seven-figure deals to slip and the sales cycles to lengthen there? And do you anticipate that to be a kinda trend going forward? And I guess, can you talk about the close rates on those slip deals for the first month of the first new year? Thanks.  to grow at a healthy clip and invest in the capacity and pipeline to put up continued growth based on what we're expecting to do this year. So, feeling pretty good about this sort of -- all of the inputs that would go into putting up those healthy growth rates over time. And I would say that when we get through FY20, which we did give formal guidance around, would expect to see fairly consistent improvement in our operating margins between this year that we're just entering now and FY22. So, call it roughly 500 basis points or so of margin expansion in each of FY21 and FY22. hether the customers direct their channel is again not the big focus versus making sure customers really use us as a cloud content management platform. We'll certainly reflect that in our comments as we go forward this year. But you will see the partnership mix continue to evolve again to bring in more of these system integrators as we're driving much bigger and more strategic solutions to our customers. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place. Markets are hyper-competitive and to compete, companies need to move faster in everything that they do. Further, every enterprise across every industry is dealing with massive cybersecurity and compliance challenges.  the sort of competitive environment or the types of win rates that we've been seeing over the past several quarters. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC 606 for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q4 year-over-year comparisons are made against Q4 results a year ago, which were under ASC 605 unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC 606 compared to ASC 605. With that, let me hand it over to Aaron. nna be really focused on growing in the regions where we are seeing better performance, such as most of the US in the field, as well as in Japan. And then as we start to see some of these things we're doing across the business roll out we may add headcount to other regions as well as that productivity improves. So, we are gonna be very, very focused on driving productivity improvements across the globe, particularly in the fields in the coming year. And there's a few different areas that we're really focused on here. ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. p or ticking down relative to the competition? , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY19 of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with. st a function of educating the sales force? orry. Around the $10 million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $10 million headwind? ncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.

Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY20. lion related to a large customer that's reducing it's spend. That on top of the midpoint of your guidance would be about $730 million, which would be a 20% growth rate next year in line with what you've done in FY19 or realistically, a deceleration from the 22% growth adjusted for ASC 606 this year. You had discussed in the past quarter and definitely the analyst days seeing an acceleration in revenue growth next year. So just help me square these two observations together and why even adding in the moving parts, that still wouldn't amount to an acceleration. Thanks. came in at 73.5% versus 76.2% a year ago and 73.6% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY19 were in line with our original expectations. We were pleased to see a slight improvement in price per seat on a year-over-year basis, mainly as a result of higher add-on product detach rates. We now have 12 million paid users. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, in FY20 we will be migrating our data center footprint to significantly lower cost regions, which will accomplish three primary goals, supporting our growth to multi-exabyte scale addressing complex customer compliance requirements and saving tens of millions of dollars over the subsequent three-year period. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers.  including at least one add-on product compared to 67% a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY19, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal '20, we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? iness and in FY20 we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we are setting revenue guidance in the range of 161-162 million. Note that Q1 has three fewer days than Q4, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than 5 million versus Q4 but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business. ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability. hen in terms of just a bundling in terms of sorta driving, I guess you could call it a cumulative add-on. How are you thinking about rolling these out?   result of the move to solutions selling. The growth rate's actually held pretty consistent throughout the year. You added some color around billings trajectory in Q1 but I'm just wondering if you're still expecting solutions selling in the move to larger deals to provide more of a back-ended seasonal pattern going forward? l our articles, The Motley Fool does not assume any responsibility for your use of this content, and we strongly encourage you to do your own research, including listening to the call yourself and reading the company's SEC filings.

What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. t we've already seen strong early signal from our customers that that is a better way to purchase and use the full breadth of Box's capabilities. t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q4 results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. e to be faster than the growth of our sales force as well. And that's certainly been the trend over time also. In terms of how it relates to the productivity in some of the trends we've seen and anytime you think about a productivity metric and not seeing all of the work that you're doing or the numbers, but I'd say the user growth is probably not as meaningful as large deal growth or billings revenue to get a sense of kinda the traction and success in the sales force. igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. han we would've liked in FY20. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through.   do you think you need to revisit the sales people that you're hiring? Are you looking for maybe a more seasoned enterprise sales candidates going forward that might be higher cost? platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. cution and inconsistency we've seen that over time we should be able to grow that as a percentage of our overall revenue as well. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q4 driving 94 deals about $100,000 or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q4 with a major technology company in the Fortune 500 that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over 40% of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster. e expect roughly the same, particularly as we grow. A larger portion of what we ultimately bill comes from renewals, so you probably won't' see us move the needle significantly given the current scale. So, should we expect to see similar trends but there to be a little bit of a shift from Q1 into Q4. rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned. all.

But overall, we have not changed our view of the momentum and the pipeline that we're seeing in the business.  l see a collection of these add-on products that are sold to customers, which will obviously be more than any individual add-on product sale.  to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $10 million headwind to FY20 revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $8 million in FY20. We expect our FY20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.01 on approximately 156 million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $1.06 to negative $1.02 on approximately 148 million shares. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY20, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. t our market opportunity and cloud content management combined with our increasingly differentiated product portfolio will allow us to achieve faster growth rates over time than what we're anticipating in FY20. While our Q4 FY19 sales results led us to lower our revenue expectations for FY20, we're encouraged by the early traction we are seeing in our solution selling strategy. We are focused on driving a reacceleration in topline growth in order to achieve our target of one billion in revenue for the full year of fiscal '22. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?  in our win rates and in our win notifications around being able to help retire and shut down legacy document management and storage infrastructure. of and market adoption of our product, our markets and market size, our operating leverage, our expectations regarding maintaining positive free cash flow and future profitability, our planned investments and growth strategies, our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and other operating model targets and expected timing and benefits of our new products and partnerships. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and actual events or results may differ materially.  expected in Q4. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. w are you thinking about that trade-off and the potential to maybe push for more growth going forward here? ide of California, which is one of the other kinda key points of this is we want more scalability with our data center footprint in lower cost locations. And that's a core factor that will then ultimately lead to better gross margin performance over time. ve seen. Just high-level US as it's our largest region, that was pretty solid overall in terms of year-on-year performance where we saw kinda the coast, west coast and east coast regions leading the charge and central and south regions had been ramping with lower productivity currently. 4 that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q1. Low to mid-teens in Q2 and Q3. And then mid to high 30s in Q4. digital supply chain where applications like Box will be used across lines of business from marketing to production and financial operations.

This included the continued development of Box Relay, Box Shield, and Box Platform. Our general and administrative costs were 17.4 million or 11% of revenue compared to 12% in Q4 of last year. We expect to drive continued leverage in G&A as we benefit from greater operational excellence and scale. Our focus on operational efficiency drove our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to a solid 10 percentage point improvement year-over-year coming in at positive 5% versus negative 5% a year ago. trong continued momentum in the $100,000 plus deal segment, and we were encouraged by the strength of the seven-figure deals in our pipeline ahead of Q4, we ultimately underperformed against our seven-figure deal expectations in the quarter. These more complex enterprise deals are taking longer to close and as a result, a few moved out of the quarter and into pipeline throughout this year. Additionally, as we previously shared, we saw weakens in EMEA throughout FY19. And in Q4, experienced a greater impact from this weakness than we anticipated. at international revenue?

I think the 100k deal segment and the 500k deal segments did show very healthy growth on a year-over-year basis.

To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY20 is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history.

With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?  years, you've grown quota carrying headcount well in excess of revenue growth and certainly in excess of billings growth. You would think if the solution sale selling is working, it would certainly be evident in your fiscal fourth quarter where these solution-based large deals really accumulate and seasonally are strong. l see a collection of these add-on products that are sold to customers, which will obviously be more than any individual add-on product sale.  do you think you need to revisit the sales people that you're hiring? Are you looking for maybe a more seasoned enterprise sales candidates going forward that might be higher cost? e to be faster than the growth of our sales force as well. And that's certainly been the trend over time also. In terms of how it relates to the productivity in some of the trends we've seen and anytime you think about a productivity metric and not seeing all of the work that you're doing or the numbers, but I'd say the user growth is probably not as meaningful as large deal growth or billings revenue to get a sense of kinda the traction and success in the sales force. now. This is an ecosystem where it's a kinda co-sell model, both direct and with partners. Fujitsu is one of them, including IBM and many other kinda major retailers in Japan. So, the growth -- we are seeing a kind of healthy relationship with Fujitsu. Both as a customer as well as a partner in that ecosystem. I'd say the broader partner ecosystem in Japan is performing very strong and we're seeing really strong results from that region.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q4 results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place. Markets are hyper-competitive and to compete, companies need to move faster in everything that they do. Further, every enterprise across every industry is dealing with massive cybersecurity and compliance challenges. w are you thinking about that trade-off and the potential to maybe push for more growth going forward here? vesting services. king it a little more formalized. What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q1 billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY19, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q1 to Q3 representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q1 billings. As such, Q1 will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q1 billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY20. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers. orry. Around the $10 million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $10 million headwind? rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned.  including at least one add-on product compared to 67% a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY19, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal '20, we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. p or ticking down relative to the competition? t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. hen in terms of just a bundling in terms of sorta driving, I guess you could call it a cumulative add-on. How are you thinking about rolling these out?  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. cution and inconsistency we've seen that over time we should be able to grow that as a percentage of our overall revenue as well. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $40 billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY20, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems.  se complexities. Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY20.   to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting. han we would've liked in FY20. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY20, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $10 million.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $10 million headwind to FY20 revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $8 million in FY20. We expect our FY20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.01 on approximately 156 million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $1.06 to negative $1.02 on approximately 148 million shares. iness and in FY20 we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we are setting revenue guidance in the range of 161-162 million. Note that Q1 has three fewer days than Q4, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than 5 million versus Q4 but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about 300 quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business. , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY19 of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. ting gross margin throughout FY20 to range from 70-71%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-70s. Q4 was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 64.6 million representing 39% of revenue, a significant improvement from 51% in the prior year, which includes a roughly 3% benefit related to the adoption of ASC 606. Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around.  expected in Q4. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $100,000 plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a 20% basis year-over-year. arter, which is up from the high-60s a year ago. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q4 driving 94 deals about $100,000 or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q4 with a major technology company in the Fortune 500 that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over 40% of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster. of and market adoption of our product, our markets and market size, our operating leverage, our expectations regarding maintaining positive free cash flow and future profitability, our planned investments and growth strategies, our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and other operating model targets and expected timing and benefits of our new products and partnerships. These statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and actual events or results may differ materially. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with. adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC 606 for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q4 year-over-year comparisons are made against Q4 results a year ago, which were under ASC 605 unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC 606 compared to ASC 605. With that, let me hand it over to Aaron.  well. Other parts of performance in FY19 as well as expectations for FY20. platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. at international revenue? Thanks, guys.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY20, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q4, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into? -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $163.7 million in Q4 up 20% year-over-year with 23% of Q4's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed 94 deals over $100,000 versus 79 a year ago, 12 deals over $500,000, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $1 million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $237.7 million representing 16% calculated and 17% adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-20s. 4 that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q1. Low to mid-teens in Q2 and Q3. And then mid to high 30s in Q4.  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. he focus here is making sure that we can really get very aggressive with all of our sales team on exactly what it takes to go and sell these much larger deals, making sure everybody's equipped with the right content messages, training to do this. It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes. competitive environment? Thanks. ve seen. Just high-level US as it's our largest region, that was pretty solid overall in terms of year-on-year performance where we saw kinda the coast, west coast and east coast regions leading the charge and central and south regions had been ramping with lower productivity currently.  management with new metadata solutions and Box platform updates. And three, advanced security classification and thread detection with Box shield. From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks. e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. came in at 73.5% versus 76.2% a year ago and 73.6% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY19 were in line with our original expectations. We were pleased to see a slight improvement in price per seat on a year-over-year basis, mainly as a result of higher add-on product detach rates. We now have 12 million paid users. As part of our hybrid cloud infrastructure strategy, in FY20 we will be migrating our data center footprint to significantly lower cost regions, which will accomplish three primary goals, supporting our growth to multi-exabyte scale addressing complex customer compliance requirements and saving tens of millions of dollars over the subsequent three-year period. lion related to a large customer that's reducing it's spend.

However, supplemental slides are now available for download from our website. We'll also post the highlights of today's call on Twitter at the handle @boxincir.  do you think you need to revisit the sales people that you're hiring? Are you looking for maybe a more seasoned enterprise sales candidates going forward that might be higher cost? -GAAP profitability and our second consecutive year of positive free cash flow as we continue to drive strong leverage in our business model. We delivered revenue of $163.7 million in Q4 up 20% year-over-year with 23% of Q4's revenue coming from regions outside the United States driven by strong performance in Japan throughout the year. We closed 94 deals over $100,000 versus 79 a year ago, 12 deals over $500,000, which was flat with a year ago, and two deals over $1 million versus nine a year ago. Fourth quarter billings came in at $237.7 million representing 16% calculated and 17% adjusted billings growth year-over-year following short of our original expectation of growth in the mid-20s. y driven by the strategic nature of these transactions and we're working to make sure that they can happen as smoothly as possible. And that we're constantly improving our own internal processes to drive these as well as the sales rigor and the operational rigor to make sure that we can get these across the finish line. I think the 100k deal segment and the 500k deal segments did show very healthy growth on a year-over-year basis. And as a note, the miss in the seven-figure deal translates through both the 500k and the 100k deal segments because it's a cumulative number.  the sort of competitive environment or the types of win rates that we've been seeing over the past several quarters.  years, you've grown quota carrying headcount well in excess of revenue growth and certainly in excess of billings growth. You would think if the solution sale selling is working, it would certainly be evident in your fiscal fourth quarter where these solution-based large deals really accumulate and seasonally are strong. he focus here is making sure that we can really get very aggressive with all of our sales team on exactly what it takes to go and sell these much larger deals, making sure everybody's equipped with the right content messages, training to do this. It's something that we're building off of a very strong foundation, fortunately, but we want to invest in this even further and get even more rigorous with our training enablement and sales processes. se complexities. Although external factors did influence a couple of these deals, such as one of the seven-figure deals were delayed because of a large merger. Another because of the government shutdown. But most of these, almost all of these deals are still in play in the pipeline and set to close throughout FY20.   result of the move to solutions selling. The growth rate's actually held pretty consistent throughout the year. You added some color around billings trajectory in Q1 but I'm just wondering if you're still expecting solutions selling in the move to larger deals to provide more of a back-ended seasonal pattern going forward?  to close. We're not seeing this as more general trend across our larger deals beyond what we had already been seeing in the business and expecting. s that we'd expected to close in the fourth quarter originally. As we sort of enter the quarter versus what ultimately happened, and then making adjustments for the deals that are near-term that we have visibility into the earlier part of the year. t of the previously mentioned churn event creates a significant headwind to Q1 billings. Finally, as we stated throughout FY19, the final payments associated with our enhanced developer fee were billed from Q1 to Q3 representing an additional couple million-dollar headwind to Q1 billings. As such, Q1 will have a particularly tough year-over-year comparison and we expect Q1 billings growth to be in the low single digit range before returning to more normalized growth rates for the remainder of FY20. s but in that seven-figure category, we were not happy about those results. We are seeing those seven-figure deals in both our Q1 and Q2 pipeline. So, we have a high degree of confidence that we'll get the majority of those things closed throughout the next couple of quarters into Q3. And we'll see the details show up. opportunity in this account in particular. Unfortunately, a miss-match to the prior set of use cases and the unique structure that was created there yet again driven by the prior leadership. So definitely a one-off from our perspective. Not something that we see any kinda consistent trend on but something that we're really focused on recovering even with this specific customer in driving future growth with.  including at least one add-on product compared to 67% a year ago. We're confident our solution selling strategy is working and now we need to aggressively drive more standardization across the business. To drive more unified global execution across all of our sales segments, we've been improving our sales training and processes. And over the past six months, we've hired or promoted new sales leaders in key growth regions across North America and EMEA. With these investments and building on the progress we saw in FY19, we remain more confident than ever in the cloud content management opportunity. As we kick off fiscal '20, we are focused on two key objectives to drive our next days of growth on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. adership in some of our kinda sub-regional segments that are running kinda key countries within EMEA. So overall, we have made some investments in very strong sales leadership and talent to help with EMEA broadly. Solution selling and really just move from enabling customers to use Box for file sharing and collaboration to really using the full suite of Box's capabilities.  ont. So, we now have the key positions that we have been searching for filled in North America and EMEA. And so those three factors, the operational product and leadership side should really help drive these productivity improvements. You should start to see that even as soon as the first half of the year particularly in the big deal growth outcomes. rigor, as well as the introduction of our product suites we believe, is going to be very helpful in increasing in the momentum there. Happy with the early signs that we're seeing, and we do expect to see some recovery on this within the first half of this year. But again, not satisfied with the Q4 results, which is driving a big part of that revenue guidance. came in at 73.5% versus 76.2% a year ago and 73.6% last quarter. As a reminder, this past year we made some upfront investments to expand our data center footprint based on the demand we've been seeing and the impact to our gross margins in FY19 were in line with our original expectations.

These forward-looking statements are being made as of today, February 27, 2019, and we disclaim any obligation to update or revise them should they change or cease to be up to date. In addition, during today's call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from our GAAP results. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP results in our earnings press release and in the related PowerPoint presentation, which can be found on the investor relations page of our website. igital workplace and powering digital business processes across the extended enterprise. To do this, our focus for the past year has been to evolve from selling Box as a tool for file sharing and storage, to consultative selling Box as a cloud content management platform for the entire enterprise with the full set of Box capabilities. Our solution selling strategy is focused on ensuring that new and existing customers see the full use cases and possibilities with cloud content management tied to significant business outcomes in the form of IT cost savings, business process acceleration, and lower security and compliance risk. with cloud content management through our go-to-market efforts. Let's start first with building the category-defining cloud content management platform. When we look around the world, digital transformation is more urgent for enterprises than ever. Companies today are working across a diverse network of global partners that demand seamless collaboration anytime at any place. Markets are hyper-competitive and to compete, companies need to move faster in everything that they do. Further, every enterprise across every industry is dealing with massive cybersecurity and compliance challenges. ting gross margin throughout FY20 to range from 70-71%. Once we complete this migration and as we continue to drive these efficiencies, we expect gross margin to trend back up toward the mid-70s. Q4 was another successful quarter of driving operational efficiency. Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter were 64.6 million representing 39% of revenue, a significant improvement from 51% in the prior year, which includes a roughly 3% benefit related to the adoption of ASC 606. Looking ahead, we expect to drive more leverage in sales and marketing as we gain greater efficiencies from our solution selling strategy.  ve seen. Just high-level US as it's our largest region, that was pretty solid overall in terms of year-on-year performance where we saw kinda the coast, west coast and east coast regions leading the charge and central and south regions had been ramping with lower productivity currently. st a function of educating the sales force? 4 that was not particularly strong for us. So, would expect probably to see growth or contribution to overall billings to breakdown in the kinda mid-teens in Q1. Low to mid-teens in Q2 and Q3. And then mid to high 30s in Q4. rch and development expenses were 29.8 million or 18% of revenue, flat with a year ago as we continue to invest in the enhancement of our product offerings. This included the continued development of Box Relay, Box Shield, and Box Platform. Our general and administrative costs were 17.4 million or 11% of revenue compared to 12% in Q4 of last year. We expect to drive continued leverage in G&A as we benefit from greater operational excellence and scale. Our focus on operational efficiency drove our Q4 non-GAAP operating margin to a solid 10 percentage point improvement year-over-year coming in at positive 5% versus negative 5% a year ago. king it a little more formalized. What did you see and where you did roll out the bundles and how is that impacting how you're thinking about the bundling this year and the timing of when those actually do roll out? the seven-figure deals to slip and the sales cycles to lengthen there? And do you anticipate that to be a kinda trend going forward? And I guess, can you talk about the close rates on those slip deals for the first month of the first new year? Thanks. e sales reps that have been environment selling kinda end to end solutions for customers. Oftentimes that can lead to as pulling candidates out of different kinds of companies than maybe we've traditionally recruited from but overall, this is all sort of priced into our expectations from a cost and sales and marketing standpoint. t we've already seen strong early signal from our customers that that is a better way to purchase and use the full breadth of Box's capabilities. orry. Around the $10 million headwind you referenced, how do you expect those deals to play out over the course of a year and any other color you can provide us in helping us get a sense of how you arrive at that $10 million headwind? hether the customers direct their channel is again not the big focus versus making sure customers really use us as a cloud content management platform. We'll certainly reflect that in our comments as we go forward this year. But you will see the partnership mix continue to evolve again to bring in more of these system integrators as we're driving much bigger and more strategic solutions to our customers. onna be our ability to bring the best workflow automation capabilities to our customers for content management. That will then allow us to say with workflow, data governance, platform, and eventually our advanced security with Shield, you can then buy that as a suite of capabilities from Box to really help with the digital transformation. So that's already been tested more or less in market through customer conversations, but we want to make that a packaged offering that we can bring to our entire customer base. e right growth rate is to grow our sales force, which is the biggest driver of the overall spend and I think variability in terms of the type of leverage that we'll see in the coming years as sales and marketing is probably the line item that's gonna be most impacted and where we expect to drive most of the leverage. Where if we are seeing pipeline and actual sales and performance in certain regions, then we will likely invest more in those regions. And if not, then you'll likely see more profitability.  in just the go-to-market. And I believe you ended the year at about 300 quotas carrying. If I kinda correlate that back, then to the billings guidance sort of implied also being kinda in the low-teens there. What are just -- if you kinda walk through the math there, kinda how you're thinking about sales productivity because obviously this skew you made a lot of changes. How are you thinking about sales productivity this coming year versus this last year and kinda the puts and takes versus just call it the headcount side? And then one quick follow-up to that.  will be launched in the middle of this year and will be sold as a stand-alone skew in addition to being a part of the new product suites we'll be offering later this year. In FY20, we will also focus on enabling intelligent content management by advancing our metadata, skills, and platform capabilities. Combined, these capabilities enable customers to retire legacy ECM technology and integrate Box into ERP systems, line of business apps, business processes, and more. For instance, one customer we closed in Q4, Lineage Logistics, international warehousing, and logistics company, will leverage Box Skills through Box platform to power new warehouse automation initiatives. an be pretty variable from quarter to quarter for a variety of factors such as payment durations and customer-driven changes to the timing of large renewals. So, I wouldn't necessarily think about the commentary we gave around billings as a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum that we're seeing in our business.  well. Other parts of performance in FY19 as well as expectations for FY20. ere our add-on product and solution selling strategies were successful in Q4 driving 94 deals about $100,000 or more include, a seven-figure deal in Q4 with a major technology company in the Fortune 500 that purchased Box Governance, Keysafe, and Platform, accounting for over 40% of their deal and transforming how they are streamlining processes around content across the organization. We also achieved a new ELA with Heidrick & Struggles, a long-standing Box customer where they purchase Box Skills, Box Multizone, and Box Platform to better coordinate between distributed global offices in their effort to find and close top executive candidates faster.  wever, those customers are still in the pipeline for this year, tend to be very large, regulated customers, often in banking or government agencies or life sciences where the deal tends to be more complex in nature from a security legal compliance standpoint. But overall, we have not changed our view of the momentum and the pipeline that we're seeing in the business. nd. So those are two separate categories that are mutually exclusive, each about $10 million. trong continued momentum in the $100,000 plus deal segment, and we were encouraged by the strength of the seven-figure deals in our pipeline ahead of Q4, we ultimately underperformed against our seven-figure deal expectations in the quarter. These more complex enterprise deals are taking longer to close and as a result, a few moved out of the quarter and into pipeline throughout this year. Additionally, as we previously shared, we saw weakens in EMEA throughout FY19. And in Q4, experienced a greater impact from this weakness than we anticipated. da start of the whole context of the overall strategy from an IT standpoint looked very different given the prior relationship structure. We had a number of use cases, some higher value than others.

Short-term deferred was up 21% and long-term deferred was down 26%. And that's, again, because of -- and the noise in headwind from the long-term deferred was because the impact of that enhanced developer fee, which was a much bigger amount of on our balance sheet a year ago. e expect roughly the same, particularly as we grow. A larger portion of what we ultimately bill comes from renewals, so you probably won't' see us move the needle significantly given the current scale. So, should we expect to see similar trends but there to be a little bit of a shift from Q1 into Q4. t our market opportunity and cloud content management combined with our increasingly differentiated product portfolio will allow us to achieve faster growth rates over time than what we're anticipating in FY20. While our Q4 FY19 sales results led us to lower our revenue expectations for FY20, we're encouraged by the early traction we are seeing in our solution selling strategy. We are focused on driving a reacceleration in topline growth in order to achieve our target of one billion in revenue for the full year of fiscal '22. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?  rates in those use cases that are more kinda cloud content management in nature. So particularly as there are a greater set of products associated with those deals as much as -- you'd always mention they tend to be more complex and, in many cases, longer deal cycles. channel partners. We didn't hear that this quarter, is there anything to read into that? Has anything changed with the health of the business with channel partners? es business processes, powers workplace collaboration, and protects an enterprise's most valuable information while also working across the best of breed modern enterprise IT stack. Heading into FY20, we are focused on extending the core capabilities that differentiate Box as a cloud content management platform and refining our solution selling motion to drive more consistent execution across the business. At the same time, we're targeting our first year of non-GAAP profitability showing further leverage in the business as we continue on our path to one billion in revenue and beyond. With that, I'll hand it over to Dylan. ch as helping customers replace and retire legacy systems, which tend to obviously improve the funding and the budgeting for Box as well. ry and our prior expectations were based around those numbers. I would also just say that certainly, there are gonna be other factors and a lot of puts and takes in the business that relate to and have an impact on FY20 growth.  management with new metadata solutions and Box platform updates. And three, advanced security classification and thread detection with Box shield. From our conversations with our largest customers, it's apparent that they have a wealth of manual business processes primed for automation. We've heard overwhelming feedback from our customers that they want simpler ways to consume workflow automation natively within Box. And this year we'll be launching an all-new Box relay built from the ground up by leveraging Box's automation capabilities announced at BoxWorks.   in our win rates and in our win notifications around being able to help retire and shut down legacy document management and storage infrastructure.  with each of these factors representing a roughly $10 million headwind to FY20 revenue versus our prior expectations. Additionally, one of our customers significantly reduced its spend with us upon its renewal earlier this month as they did not realize the full value of their initial use cases. This was a unique customer situation which will represent a revenue headwind of approximately $8 million in FY20. We expect our FY20 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of negative $0.03 to positive $0.01 on approximately 156 million diluted shares. Our GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of negative $1.06 to negative $1.02 on approximately 148 million shares.  to grow at a healthy clip and invest in the capacity and pipeline to put up continued growth based on what we're expecting to do this year. So, feeling pretty good about this sort of -- all of the inputs that would go into putting up those healthy growth rates over time. And I would say that when we get through FY20, which we did give formal guidance around, would expect to see fairly consistent improvement in our operating margins between this year that we're just entering now and FY22. So, call it roughly 500 basis points or so of margin expansion in each of FY21 and FY22.  seat basis are the tailwind that we get from the incremental value from these add-on products and a higher value use cases offset by these larger deals with more seats as we tend to give volume discounting. ar too difficult to share content and manage business processes across the extended enterprise in addition to being too costly and complex for the digital age. The enterprise content management and storage infrastructure markets represent $40 billion in opportunity and Box is the only cloud-native platform built to power the next generation of workloads as they rapidly move from on-prem to the cloud. Entering FY20, we have the most exciting product roadmap in our company's history focused entirely on enabling our customers to power their digital business processes and to retire legacy content management systems. rowth of our customers and that requires us to move into much more scalable data center facilities in addition to our hybrid cloud usage of public cloud partners. And so, as a result of that, that means we have to operate out of two extra data centers from a redundancy standpoint temporarily while we're making that migration happen, which obviously has an impact on gross margin as Dylan mentioned. s a little bit higher than in most quarters by the really strong growth that we saw in Japan that we mentioned as virtually all of those deals are through the channel. tinuing to make sure we can go and drive solutions sales into our customers and much bigger transactions into our accounts.  data governance capabilities, and open platform, will only continue to get stronger over time as we move customers from using Box as a productivity and collaboration tool to really a cloud content management platform. platform. While the majority of our customers' leverage Box today for secure collaboration and productivity, we know the big opportunity is to power our customers' digital business processes in the cloud. Within our existing customer base alone, there are billions of dollars in potential revenue upside as our customers begin to leverage Box's full set of capabilities across their organizations. digital supply chain where applications like Box will be used across lines of business from marketing to production and financial operations. We began implementing our solution selling strategy in FY19 and while we're encouraged by our early progress, we're working to further improve our execution through, number one, improved sales training, rigorous sales processes, and updates to our sales compensation plans tied to solution selling. Two, hiring and promoting experienced world-class sales leadership talent throughout all segments of the field globally. tunately, due to the complexity of some of these transactions, some of that is not fully within our control. I'd say, due to the kinds of customers we're talking about where the intellectual property that's within their files and their data is very sensitive. Could be client records, could be government data and information. It just puts a very high threshold on the security review, the compliance review, the data privacy reviews of our customers, which often involves a pretty broad set of individuals and parts of the organization that we have to go and work through. a couple of numbers there. I think overall when we look at the broader base of large deals, especially the $100,000 plus segment, which are -- while they don't represent the full impact of our CCM platform being sold to customers, they are often representative of the kinds of customers that are using Box in more strategic ways. And we have seen that base of customers grow at about a 20% basis year-over-year. hat were some of the original use cases that they thought they were gonna realize and why weren't they able to meet those targets or realize those use cases? What were some of the unforeseen circumstances they ran into? ide of California, which is one of the other kinda key points of this is we want more scalability with our data center footprint in lower cost locations. And that's a core factor that will then ultimately lead to better gross margin performance over time. To solve this, we will be launched Box Shield as an add-on product later this year. Box Shield will bring intelligent threat detection and content classification natively into Box. We're already hearing from prospective customers that Shield will be transformational to their security and risk posture in protecting critical intellectual property. FY20 is setting up to be the most exciting year for product innovation in Box's history. And due to the increasing success of our add-on products, we'll be making it much easier for our customers to adopt the full power of our cloud content management platform by launching new product suites in the first half of FY20. cognition standard under the modified retrospective transition method. Having adopted ASC 606 for this fiscal year under the modified retrospective transition method, all Q4 year-over-year comparisons are made against Q4 results a year ago, which were under ASC 605 unless otherwise stated. Please refer to our press release and the supplemental financial deck on our investor relations website for a reconciliation of our financial results under ASC 606 compared to ASC 605. With that, let me hand it over to Aaron. p plan incentives that we have in place just to further align that with our solution selling strategy. I think we've been pretty pleased with the way that's showed up this past year in add-on products and generally in large deals. So, the second component is around the product capabilities. We are gonna be making Box Relay generally available in the first half of this year. The new Box Relay, as well as Box Shield in the second half. d then eventually suites to our customers, we see a tremendous amount of opportunity just within our existing customer base, multiple billions of dollars of revenue just within our existing customer base, especially at the top customers.  expected in Q4. And that's how it would roll through the year on the revenue front. It does take -- we basically have a few different categories of deals depending on our confidence in closing those deals from committed to different probabilities associated with that and so it's really looking at that weighted expected impact of those deals that are in those kinda firmer categories versus what ultimately happened in the fourth quarter. , we're seeing that more of our sales reps are driving add-on product sales really driving much more strategic relationships with customers. But I would say that we're disappointed with the speed at which this is rolling out throughout the business. We just did our sales kickoff about two weeks ago and a really kinda great opportunity obviously reenergized the entire team and really bring to life some incredible examples from throughout FY19 of very large strategic transactions we're able to drive. our years, we've been adding additional value-added products like data governance, our platform capabilities, advanced security capabilities, add-on solutions around the core. What we're finding is as we're moving more toward solutions selling larger transactions, we want to get out of the mode of selling each individual product on a one-off basis to customers and really being able to bring the full suite of Box's cloud content management platform to our customers. t we again kicked off last year. So last year we kind of -- was the start of this evolution and again, we're not satisfied with the complete speed in which we're doing this but we're seeing very strong early success and now we're just building on that momentum coming into this year and again, really optimistic about the results. ypes of sales cycles, we do see way greater customer retention. Obviously, much larger deal sizes. And then ultimately, so much more of our differentiation is able to benefit from these deals as well. We do expect that this becomes the bulk of our business as we reach one billion in revenue and beyond. But it is an evolution to get there and it's something that, again, we're not satisfied with the speed at which we're driving that execution through the whole company, but we are seeing some incredible pockets of success that we now want to go replicate and drive more uniform execution around. l our articles, The Motley Fool does not assume any responsibility for your use of this content, and we strongly encourage you to do your own research, including listening to the call yourself and reading the company's SEC filings.

How are you thinking about rolling these out? ors and our work with the larger technology integrators of the likes of Excentra, Deloitte, et cetera. But we really wanted to make sure that we covered the broader evolution that's happening with our go-to-market efforts, which is much more about how do we take the full powered Box to our customers and drive upsells with add-on products. , the fact that we're obviously onboarding new reps and then the need to continue to improve our sales rigor and processes, that is taking longer than we'd like to have the full dent on our revenue growth that we would expect. So again, we're not satisfied with the results however we have an incredible amount of confidence based on the early trends that we're seeing within the customer base. A lot of customers that we're talking to about cloud content management and how that's going to impact how they transform their businesses and thus we see the size of the opportunity going forward. han we would've liked in FY20. It does put even more of a need for that reacceleration on us but when we look at the opportunity, when we look at our customer base, when we look at our leadership position and our add-on products that we have, this is something that we're very confident in continuing to drive. e to be faster than the growth of our sales force as well. And that's certainly been the trend over time also. In terms of how it relates to the productivity in some of the trends we've seen and anytime you think about a productivity metric and not seeing all of the work that you're doing or the numbers, but I'd say the user growth is probably not as meaningful as large deal growth or billings revenue to get a sense of kinda the traction and success in the sales force. es that revenue is gonna have to accelerate to 20% CAGR over the following two years. And if it is still on the table, what is it that's giving you confidence in that? And then I've got a follow-up for Dylan.  to now much more of a strategic platform where customers are automating their business processes where in many cases they're dealing with much more regulated information where compliance and security even more important, where content might even go out and reach through their manufacturing processes or supply chains or customer base. And the fact that they're able to shut down legacy systems. nna be really focused on growing in the regions where we are seeing better performance, such as most of the US in the field, as well as in Japan. And then as we start to see some of these things we're doing across the business roll out we may add headcount to other regions as well as that productivity improves. So, we are gonna be very, very focused on driving productivity improvements across the globe, particularly in the fields in the coming year. And there's a few different areas that we're really focused on here. iness and in FY20 we are targeting our first year of delivering non-GAAP profitability. For the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we are setting revenue guidance in the range of 161-162 million. Note that Q1 has three fewer days than Q4, which creates a revenue headwind of a little more than 5 million versus Q4 but does not impact year-over-year comparisons. While we don't typically guide to billings, we want to provide some color around how we expect billings to trend throughout the year. While we generally expect our revenue and billings growth rates to track roughly in line, year-over-year comparisons of this metric can be variable from quarter to quarter and thus is not always a meaningful indicator of the underlying momentum of our business. p or ticking down relative to the competition?",3

The solution can be extended on a modular basis and is intuitive and easy to operate. Ritter Sport also plans to install Sentron PAC measuring devices in order to connect even more measurement points to the system. nk data from a range of sources such as production, building technology and energy production. The company is thus able to correlate consumption and production data and to understand how much energy is required by which process. This is the only way to detect potential savings. The information is available via both stationary and mobile devices and can be quickly retrieved. Benjamin Flaig, Energy Manager at Ritter Sport, provides a positive summary: ""I have a motto – energy efficiency means being smart with minimum effort. The Simatic Energy Manager fits this perfectly as a great deal can be gained here with very little expense."" , production and products, but also regards sustainability as a major priority. It was awarded the Sustainability Award for its work in this area in 2018. In order to provide optimum monitoring of its own cogeneration plant and therefore to reduce its overall energy consumption, Ritter Sport has installed Siemens energy management solutions. The aim is to use this to reduce energy consumption by 1.5 percent per year.  long the whole value chain. It is therefore no surprise that electricity comes from environmentally-friendly, in-house sources – such as the cogeneration plant put into operation in 2002. Following modernization in 2016, the cogeneration plant now supplies 9.9 million kilowatt hours. Ritter Sport therefore covers a good third of its energy demands and 70 percent of its heat requirement. The chocolate manufacturer is now using the Siemens Simatic Energy Manager Pro energy management software to reduce its energy consumption year on year and to meet the requirements of ISO 50001 (the standard for the development of systematic energy management).",3

Haney drew her own sketches and found a place in the garment district to produce small batches of “recreation kits”: a cropped compression top and a pair of compression leggings made from the new fabric; a slim-fitting hoodie; a cropped T-shirt; and a pair of joggers. She started giving kits to friends to “go out and do things in.” She brainstormed names for the brand—thanks to some randomized word-searching, it was Fritz Farouk for a while, then it was Track Practice.  Fresh Produce’s orders. When Haney was fifteen, she began cleaning the shop twice a week in exchange for screen-printing privileges. (One of the T-shirts she made said “Famous People Wear This Shit.”) At the time, she says, she never considered going into the family business. As a junior in high school, she went to Germany as the groom for the U.S. Equestrian Team; during the trip, a rider who had rented a silver Mercedes asked Haney to return it to the rental company. “I’m from a pretty humble background,” Haney told me, “and I remember the moment when I was sitting on the Autobahn, on the phone with my mom, and just thinking, Holy shit. There is so much in the world. There are so many cool things that, if you put yourself out there, you can do.” ny’s advertising is geared toward women, but OV also has devoted male fans—a company rep told me that many male customers buy multiple versions of the same shorts for years.) Three girls in Teddy-bear coats, pale-rimmed glasses, and expensively highlighted hair waited in line to pay. There were neon dog leashes, bright-blue #doingthings baseball hats, $290 Spalwart sneakers, and battered copies of the 1981 “Jane Fonda Workout Book” ($40) and the 1977 “Vogue Body and Beauty Book” ($50) for sale. e ludicrously energetic instructor turned on a booming reggaeton mix and launched into a 2-A.M.-at-the-club dance routine so saucy and contagious that everyone around me screamed. It was a hot, thick, strange day, and soon everyone was booty-popping, body-rolling, unhinged by glee. I took videos so that I could show my friends what I was doing. I felt amazing—porous and overcome. Afterward, I talked to a student named Jesse, whom I’d spotted in the crowd. He wore a U.T. polo, rolled-up khakis, shower slides, and tube socks. He’d just been walking by, and had joined in; he’d never heard of Outdoor Voices or Zumba. He was buzzing. “That was so, so great,” he said, dazed.  I was planning to buy for research purposes: a navy crop top and a pair of color-blocked leggings. Then I tried on a black exercise dress, a pair of feather-light running shorts with a pink spackle pattern, and high-waisted dance leggings in a muted pastel-heather color called Super Bloom. I work out regularly, but only in sale-rack offerings from Old Navy and Target, and only by walking my dog and attending group fitness classes that allow me to lie down. Still, as a millennial woman with disposable income and an Instagram account, I am squarely in the OV demographic, and my brain began to swirl with unrecognizable visions: me, in a gray crop top and fifty-five-dollar shorts, running up the steps at Fort Greene Park; me, taking a selfie mid-run. OV’s clothes perfectly suit an era in which, for many women, improving their looks and their life style has become a job that they’re supposed to regard as fun—I couldn’t imagine simply puttering around my apartment in a bright crop top that bared several inches of midriff and leggings so tight that a thong shows through. (Later, I learned that most of the young women who work for OV don’t wear underwear when they work out.) High on potential, I went to the cash register and paid for two hundred and sixty-five dollars’ worth of clothes that I could not reasonably expense.    ssador hashtag, it’s nearly impossible to tell one type of picture from another: F.T.C. guidelines instruct users to disclose in detail any “material connection” to a brand they’re endorsing, but these rules are frequently sidestepped. Instagram encourages all users to act as influencers, and OV fans often allow the brand to promote their freely posted #doingthings photos in ads. “Probably ninety-five per cent of the ads you see on Instagram are user-generated,” the company’s general manager told me. (She later clarified that this was a rough, and probably hyperbolic, estimate.) Nike built its identity by paying celebrity athletes millions of dollars to serve as the faces of the brand. Outdoor Voices advertises non-famous people who mostly do not get paid but whose lives, thanks to social media, are refracted through the usual mechanisms of celebrity. inguish what was good from what was profitable, or my life from my work. It was dark in the studio, and the ceiling sparkled like a planetarium. A sign at the back of the room read “Total Human Optimization.” In a sweet, soft voice, the instructor told us, “Every part of you that’s not active is weighing you down.” ♦ gs of twig tea and plates of green-bean-and-avocado tacos and Swiss chard with tahini. I told Haney that my takeaway from the success of her cohort was more about what we expect and want from young women. Advantages for women tend to harden into requirements. The careers of very successful millennial women, from Haney to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are often inseparable from their ability to engage large online audiences in a personal way. All of the women whom we were talking about, I ventured, are beautiful. All of them give perfect interviews. The women Haney mentioned had all built companies on a foundation of female confidence, creating brands that imbued personal identity with an aspirational sheen. “I’ve been thinking about what it is to be a woman, and to understand yourself—your body, your life—as a source of potential,” I said. “It can feel like such a gift, and it can also feel like a punishment, and it can be hard, online, even as norms are being challenged, to understand which of the two is in play.”  entally clipped his ear. They moved to Boulder, Colorado, when Haney, a tomboy with a bowl cut, was still young. The oldest of three kids, Haney was athletic and extremely competitive, riding horses before school, playing on the boys’ soccer team, running track. Haney’s mom has an identical twin, Mary Ellen, who lived a block away and taught Haney how to run hurdles, in the back yard, using a broomstick. space off Craigslist and bought a very used Mercedes, which would run only when the heat was on full blast. She persuaded an L.A. factory to produce a tiny number of her kits, and she took samples to a fashion trade show in Las Vegas, where a buyer from a London boutique saw them and ordered a handful for his shop. A few months later, a buyer for J. Crew visited the boutique, and placed an order with Haney for eleven thousand units. McGuire connected Haney with friends in Austin, who, along with Mary Ellen and friends of Haney’s in Boulder, provided the money necessary to fulfill the order. hey told me that, last year, after Haney’s dog died, the whole company surprised her by throwing her a birthday luau. They also told me a story about how, on the new V.P. of community’s first visit to the Austin office, she observed what they regarded as the definitive thing about the company: that all of the employees seem as if they would be willing to work there even if they were not being paid. ich suggested that I could be proud of my dog-walking and my sullen participation in barre classes. For the next few weeks, I worked out a lot, which put me in a terrific, if conflicted, mood. Sixty per cent of working Americans say they don’t have enough time to do the things they want to do, and a high income is the most reliable predictor of leisure-time physical activity; getting a lot of exercise feels like a luxury and an advantage. Exercise has kept my head clear, my mood even, my body predictable, my energy up. It has also helped me compete in a culture of escalating beauty expectations and increasingly boundless work. Am I taking care of myself, doing sun salutations in my motivational crop top, or am I running survival drills for life under an advanced capitalist economy? The answer, I’m sure, is both. er to building real value,” she said. “There aren’t a lot of brands and companies that go from here to here”—she mimed hockey-stick growth—“that you still have real love and affinity for. I’d rather grow a hundred per cent for twenty years than go 10x for three years and make this into a trend, and then not be here.” Catlett, the new president and C.O.O., told me that her previous employers, Nike and Under Armour, for all their success, had never quite captured, as brands, what many of their customers expressed in surveys—that they were drawn to sport for the fun of it. “Why do you think that is?” I asked her. “Is there something about performance and quantified excellence that’s fundamentally at odds with ease and joy?” Catlett told me that she had no idea how to answer that question. onnected to the clothing brand Outdoor Voices, which was founded by a graduate of the Parsons School of Design named Tyler Haney, in 2014, when she was twenty-five years old. OV makes crop tops and shorts and leggings and fleeces that are soft but well structured and come in colors like lagoon and rose quartz—the company’s advertising helped pioneer a now ubiquitous consumer aesthetic of tasteful minimalist saturation that you might call Sensual Organic Algorithm. Women’s apparel makes up eighty per cent of the company’s sales. The trademark OV look is a racerback crop top and a matching pair of high-waisted leggings, an outfit designed to shape and flatter the body, and to expose it: OV’s textured compression fabric is so snug that it borders on disciplinary, and its leggings “sculpt” the body, like Spanx. The clothes photograph beautifully—somehow, they make the wearer look as if she were put on earth to be viewed on Instagram, posing against a forest vista in flamingo-colored spandex and a smile. een-seventies, photos of Jane Goodall and of Mariel Hemingway circa “Personal Best.” Haney emerged from a meeting, tanned and smiling, wearing a short black skirt, a white OV polo, and a black woollen sweater, and the employees nearby became subtly more eager and attentive, the way people do when their boss, or a very attractive person, or a boss who happens to be a very attractive person, enters the room. I introduced myself, and she instantly recalibrated her vibrancy to fit the contours of my attention, like a phone screen adjusting its brightness according to the light. “I’m really looking forward to spending time,” she said, looking at me with warm brown eyes. and had brought a male friend. We sat down on the rubber floor, joining a group of young white women staring raptly at a petite holistic nutritionist, who advised us to engage in resistance training twice a week and to consider going vegetarian if grass-fed beef was outside our budget. “Eighty to ninety per cent of what you eat should have a point,” she said. Everyone nodded. I pictured the sausage-egg-and-cheese bagel sandwich I’d eaten on the train to Boston. It had a point, I thought: I was hungover before I ate it, and after I ate it I was not hungover anymore. After the talk, my friend asked me, “Did it seem like all her advice was predicated on having a lot of money and free time?” tes almost like a subscription service: the design team plans a six-month season, and clothes drop once a month, sometimes after being teased on Instagram by Haney, who has a winsome smile and an athletic figure and is her brand’s best model. But the company also has nine stores, with at least two more slated to open this year. The one in SoHo has pastel foam blocks to sit on, clothes racks modelled on Donald Judd’s aluminum boxes in Marfa, Texas, and fitting rooms of different shapes built from various woods and metals. The store smelled, oddly, like my apartment—a sensation I understood after I saw the Maison Louis Marie No.04 candle burning atop the cash wrap. Rows of tops ($45 to $75) and leggings ($75 to $95) formed a restrained rainbow. A black mini-skort with a hand-daubed polka-dot pattern was $65. I brushed my fingers across a rack of tops and bottoms, in lilac and emerald and charcoal and scarlet, which you could mix and match for $95. This was far more than I had ever paid for workout clothing—though less than Lululemon, which was Haney’s intention. , and, after graduation, moved to Boston, on a whim. She waited tables at the Border Café, in Harvard Square, where members of the New England Patriots sometimes came in for fajitas. Beginning to discover the extent of her magnetism, Haney befriended the linebacker Junior Seau, who invited her to Gillette Stadium for a post-game dinner. There she met Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen. The world, again, seemed huge and astonishing. , I paid a visit. In the entryway to the white-walled, light-filled central building, a corkboard was plastered with photos of dozens of employees’ dogs. Haney had a beloved Havapoo, named Bowie, who, last year, the week before Haney turned thirty, was hit by a truck, right in front of the office. His photo, decorated with wings and a halo, was perched above the others. Haney now has a miniature Australian shepherd named Juice. (His Instagram handle is @juicedoingthings.) OV has just over a hundred employees in Austin—their ages seemed to range from plausible college student to mid-thirties. On this unseasonably warm day, they were all dressed playfully, in bandannas and novelty baseball caps, jumpsuits and wide-legged denim. Many of them wore OV.  cosmetics outfit Glossier, the fashion retailer Nasty Gal, the dating app Bumble, and the Wing, a chain of co-working spaces. Haney is friendly with the founders of each of those companies. “With every one of these women, we’re all leaning into our personality, deriving what we create from our personal experience,” she told me. “I think that’s fine-tuned my perspective—that it’s totally possible for people to create a similar narrative, journey, even company, from their lives.”  occasionally thinking about the gym. “Every product that we make is made to sweat in,” she has said. Chip Wilson, the Canadian founder of Lululemon, the company sometimes credited with creating the athleisure market, also refuses the label: in his memoir, “Little Black Stretchy Pants,” he insists that athleisure is for Diet Coke-drinking mall shoppers in New Jersey who wear pink velour, whereas the ideal Lululemon customer is a thirty-two-year-old woman named Ocean who earns six figures and has ninety minutes to work out every day. But both OV and Lululemon appeal to the desire to wear workout clothes around the clock, and Haney has succeeded in part because Wilson’s ritzy vision—picture Ocean in black leggings and a rich-mom tank top—has, for many younger women, become passé. Athleisure, in any case, means different things for different people. I tend to think of it as activewear that costs more than seems entirely sensible, or as a spandex-clad arm of the long-standing ideology that urges women to improve the market value of their physical form.  blue buckets and tall shovels as a woman from the Trail Foundation, which OV sponsors, demonstrated how to plant saplings of Carolina buckthorn and Texas redbud. The saplings would take fifteen years to become sizable, she said, and only thirty per cent of them would manage to become trees. “Long game!” Haney said. She leaned in close to observe the tree-planting technique. Then she planted three times as many trees as anyone else. k for a design firm; a year later, she got a day job at a fashion-startup incubator called Launch Collective. As a teen-ager, Haney had mostly worn vintage clothes that she altered on her sewing machine, but she started to gravitate toward the idea of a stylish uniform: cropped white T-shirts and simple A-line skirts. She had begun dating a successful restaurateur from Austin named Larry McGuire. Soon after completing the Parsons program, she announced her entrepreneurial plans in a video that she posted on Tumblr. With her ash-blond hair in layers, and a box of Kashi cereal on the shelves behind her, she said that she was starting an activewear brand. “I’ve decided to blog about the experience,” she said, “because I’ve found that you see a lot of brands that you admire but you don’t know how they got there. And I’ve decided to be very transparent about it, and show the process, and allow people to see the mistakes, the difficulties, what I struggle with, as well as the successes.” She hoped, she said, that following her journey would be fun and entertaining—a “great experience for us all.” n, OV emphasizes low-key workouts and everyday movement. The company became familiar to the fashion-conscious—and to many Manhattan commuters—in part through its tote bags, which bear the gnomic slogan “Technical Apparel for Recreation.” The idea is that, in the absence of quantified results and competitive pressure, physical activity will feel like play.",2

Now, since labor is the foundation of human society, when it changes radically and rapidly across nations, everything else that connects the human society falls apart as well. As we look around, we can see those old systems, models, and ways of doing things are struggling to survive as a new way of doing things is emerging rapidly. This new way of doing things requires entirely different skill sets and capabilities -- approaches and expectations for the work that many don't even fully understand yet. ill look in terms of the human workforce working alongside (or maybe for) a machine workforce. At the same time, it is also essential to evaluate how entities across nations: their governments, industries, organizations, and academia (NGIOA) are evolving themselves due to competitive pressures and technological breakthroughs.

It is going to be difficult for humans to evaluate what's left for the human workforce to do as machine workforce takes over.  the speed at which they unfold can be hard to predict for any nation or its decision makers.

Besides, a digitally-enabled independent human work is rising. While independent work for humans is nothing new, and self-employment is, still the predominant form of employment in emerging economies, the digital enablement of it is a significant change, as the proportion of independent work that is conducted on digital platforms is proliferating. This is primarily due to the scale, efficiency, and ease of use for the human workforce that these digital platforms enable.

The conversation, however, rarely considers the humans in this equation. As our job roles inevitably evolve, what kind of work will humans still need to do? And, how will we measure human performance in a machine-led future? ore impactful than industrialisation or globalisation, and in less than fifteen years machines will handle every single task (white collar, blue collar, gold collar or new collar) that does not require humanness.

We are a lot better than that!   as fellow humans, even deserving human rights. Yet as all the recent miracles of robotic intelligence and their real world failures show, even the best AI is still very much trapped in what is best described in the Chinese Room argument. A machine equipped with a really good dictionary can get almost infinitely fast at responding to a short Chinese phrase or word fed to it on one side of his box, and then send the translation to the other side - but it still has no actual understanding of the content it has just processed. It is not aware, nor sentient, nor conscious; it has no agency, no purpose, no existence, and is therefore still only very narrowly intelligent. It does not ‘speak Chinese’ - it just translates input to output very well. g with mystery and serendipity, but on the other hand we cannot compute the vast amounts of data that machines will be able to instantly crunch in the very near future. The reality is that soon, we will reach a point where machines will easily exceed us in the mechanical and routine performance metrics that we currently uphold for ourselves. Machines are exponential, and humans are not. This realization is crucial, and we must formulate the new definition of work based upon it. ey Performance Indicators (KPI) such as efficiency, speed, accuracy, lead generation and sales performance are widely used to measure success. Now, consider the wave of workplace game-changers: big data, the cloud, the Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, intelligent assistants and so-called artificial intelligence (AI). These are the things that are propelling us towards a new era of automation, virtualisation and robotization.  chine simply could not know because these are particular ‘learnings’ that every human immediately understands, and have never been turned into data. Beware of HR analytics or AI-hiring-bots for exactly this reason: they can be useful but they are not ‘the truth’ by themselves. Hiring a person because they performed well during an AI-led interview is like going to any restaurant just because Tripadvisor recommends it - the real world just isn’t that simple!

As we look to the next 10 years I believe that many routine tasks will be 60 - 90% automated, with the remaining 10-40% of ‘human tasks’ likely to be assigned to just a few remaining humans. The call-center makes for the best example here: while it is routine work to reschedule a flight, it is not routine at all to deal with a customer that has had his flight canceled 3 times in a row, and requires some compassion and extra effort that may involve bending the rules.  shift to encompass this change.",3

And so, we dedicate time when our associates can come out of their jobs, into these innovation stations or empowerment stations, and really work together on solving problems. We also have a system where employees at any level in the company can cascade these new ideas and concepts that they’ve seen out in the market, or internally, within Synchrony, so that we can look to them and help prioritize our strategy for the future, to ensure it’s really meeting our customers’ needs.

We want you to ensure that you’re being a critical thinker and creative. Because if you’re not focused in those areas, and we’re not all moving forward in that same direction, the competition is going to beat us.

The U.K.’s Office of National Statistics, which publishes its own analysis, says the gap is caused, in part, by more women working part-time, clustering in occupations with lower pay and taking time out to have children.

A self-managing mainframe that employs intelligence and automation can heal and manage itself automatically with minimal manual intervention. For example, with predictive analytics and Machine Learning capabilities, a self-managing mainframe can learn from thousands of outage conditions and automatically apply that intelligence and learning to predict issues, recommend fixes and take action.  nkfully, the mainframe has a place in helping companies run and reinvent their business. It is capable of scaling to handle ever-increasing transaction volumes efficiently and securely, and we are excited to see where it will go next. With the combination of fresh talent, executive buy-in and new intelligent automation technologies, the mainframe remains a crucial element in the enterprise IT landscape today — and in the future.  ems partly from its ability to reinvent itself constantly to facilitate the changing dynamics of modern business, maintain near-constant availability and efficiently process billions of critical transactions – proving to be a viable long-term platform today.  pplication modernisation and embrace AI for IT Operations (AIOps) and Machine Learning to empower their changing workforce.  edicted growth in mainframe workloads in 2018 and beyond – the highest level in five years.   achieving a self-managing platform. Mounting demands around regulatory compliance and risk mitigation have also created a greater need for a secure and reliable solution such as the mainframe, especially one that can predict and mitigate risks before they occur. Even DevOps teams are taking note – more organisations are applying agile/DevOps approaches to their mainframe environments than ever before. automated DevOps can help companies become more agile and free up crucial DBA time, deeming organisations’ enterprise IT more profitable and efficient.  w and legacy applications.

In many cases, those steps were made possible by ""bean stock,"" the company's parlance for the corporate stock made available to employees.

The answer to that is yes, if he runs the tables to carry nearly all the closely divided states including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. t a company that took the long view, that sought to facilitate that all-too-infrequent human interaction between people who otherwise might never meet, might not ever have people encourage them on tough days or rough patches of life when it is crucial to have courage to build a career, return to school, or otherwise take on life. y voters will, therefore, buy into the argument that a third-party candidate is simply a spoiler.

It might have ten berries underneath it, but you might only want three”—the ripe ones. “You have to be able to decide which three. There’s an intelligence factor built into that.” salad greens—arugula, bok choy, butterhead lettuce, kale, and herbs that grow under panels of L.E.D. lights. Right now, L.E.D. lighting is the cheapest and most efficient way of replacing the sun, but it’s still a major expense for vertical farms that old-fashioned greenhouses don’t have. ere dressed in faded long-sleeved shirts or hoodies, baseball caps, bandannas, jeans, and work boots.  lock to enter the farm. There are no pests, so no need for pesticides on Bowery’s greens, which is a major selling point. During the recent outbreak of E. coli on romaine from California, Bowery’s lettuce was guaranteed to be safe, although it still fell under the nationwide ban imposed by the Centers for Disease Control. Fain knocked on the table in a sitting area for good luck when I brought up the possibility of pests ever getting in, and what might happen if they did. In Biosphere 2—the failed science experiment from the nineties that was, among other things, an indoor-farming venture—pests and plant disease flourished. But humans, not a computer operating system, were running Biosphere 2. n pickers, who need only a few seconds per bush, use most of that time working their hands through the leaves, each robot, which spends eight seconds per plant, devoted seven and a half of them just to hovering about a foot above the bush, motionless, as though contemplating it. Two stereoscopic cameras per robot, equipped with multi-spectrum and infrared vision that can see berries through the canopy, scanned the plant in a second and a half, and made a virtual 3-D map of it. (If the harvester has encountered the same plant before, it can add this data to what it has already learned about the plant, using a high-speed link to connect with the cloud.) The system then ran all the information through its algorithms and targeted those berries at peak ripeness, based on color, size, and the amount of time that the fruit had already spent on the plant.  er than address that, they would prefer to eliminate it altogether.” He added, “Mental mechanization of labor has been going on for decades—essentially seeing workers as robots and demanding higher and higher productivity with less and less regard to their human condition. So for them to flip the switch into actual robots is hardly a groundbreaking decision. It’s just the next phase in the process.” orn, had arrived at first light, fanning out over Wish Farms’ six hundred acres of strawberry fields, one of the largest contiguous patches in North America. ce could see the robots at work. The crowd surged forward with cameras. Each of the robots was equipped with a patented “Pitzer wheel”—the appendage that does the actual picking. The wheel had six soft-rubber clawlike “obtainers” that are able to cup the berries and pivot, imitating the popping action that human pickers make with their wrists.  The lettuce in a produce aisle in New York could have been picked two or three weeks before you buy it; in terms of nutrients, you may be better off with frozen vegetables. An indoor farm’s proximity to population centers is supposed to make it greener. S. coördinates. Because the robot knows exactly where the tomato plants are and has the machine vision and intelligence to know the difference between a tomato plant and a weed, it can navigate around the tomatoes and kill the weeds either with a miniature hoe or with a micro-jet of herbicide, which Slaughter described as “an inkjet printer for agriculture.” The farmer saves the cost of weeding the field by hand, and spares it a coating of herbicide that many of the tomato plants might not need. It was the nearest thing I saw in what venture capitalists call “digital agriculture” to a Roomba, the indoor robotic vacuum cleaner—a Farmba, maybe? . “My closest competitors realize we’re all in the same boat,” he told me. His partner, Pitzer, who is forty-nine and previously worked at Intel, helped produce “Battle Bots,” the gladiator-style television show in which warrior robots fight one another. The two men are the co-founders of a tech startup called Harvest Croo, which stands for “computerized robotic optimized obtainer.” They hope to have an “alpha” prototype of the harvester ready for commercial use by the end of this year—an ambitious goal. The plan is to lease the machines to farmers for the same amount as or less than they are paying for labor now. This way, in theory, a large capital investment isn’t required of the individual farmers. a strawberry. Manufacturing takes place inside highly structured environments in which everything that happens is predictable; there are no variables. Strawberries growing outdoors in various states of ripeness present seemingly infinite variations. mated systems, because of the factorylike regularity of the setting.) The Netherlands is a global leader in indoor farming. Although it is a densely populated country less than a third of the size of New York State, the Netherlands is the world’s second-largest exporter of food, in terms of value, after the U.S., and it leads the world in exports of potatoes, onions, and tomatoes. By using precision-agriculture techniques, Dutch indoor farmers have dramatically cut the use of water and pesticides, while also avoiding consolidation and allowing individual farmers to flourish. “The Netherlands is probably the most technologically sophisticated country in terms of agriculture production,” Erik Nicholson, of the United Farm Workers, told me. “But the Netherlands model is not predicated on a large concentration of growers. You have active government and labor intervention and coördination to make sure these technologies are enhancing the ability of Dutch nationals to grow rather than wiping them out.” . In one section, every plant has its own G.P.S. coördinates—a kind of virtual strawberry farm, made of data, that exists in the Microsoft cloud. t the cost of using lighting will ever go low enough to make vertical farms economical, or whether the energy these farms might save in transportation would be lost to the electricity needed to power the lights.  to help him breed plants that would be easier for the machine to pick. At U.C. Davis, David Slaughter had shown me pictures of flat apple trees that were being bred at the University of Washington for the same reason. ich include the bulk of the fresh produce we buy in the supermarket. Partly as a result, specialty-crop farms have remained smaller, on average, than the huge farms that grow most of the grain and corn. Many specialty crops require delicate handling or selective harvesting—choosing only the ripe fruits and vegetables—and the big machines are often too clumsy and unintelligent for that kind of work. Large numbers of human laborers are still necessary at harvest time, as has been the case since the dawn of agriculture. The farmer still needs hands, literally, to do the picking. A.I. is the farmer. Bowery’s operations are overseen by Brian Donato, who previously helped manage Amazon’s automated fulfillment centers, now staffed with humans and Kiva robots. Donato told me, “I was there before we had the Kiva acquisition”—Amazon bought the robot-maker in 2012—“and there through the transition, so I saw how to do everything just with people, and then I saw how we transitioned to do everything with stronger automation.” tify them by working their hands through the thick canopy of leaves with little fruit-seeking movements of their fingers, catching the stem of the ripe berries in the webbing of their fingers, and cupping the fruit. Then, with a wristy twist that prevents bruising around the calyx, they pluck the berry from the vine the way you might pop a frosty can of beer from a six-pack. ebug the harvesters when something goes wrong. Mary Lou de Leon Siantz, a colleague of David Slaughter’s at the University of California at Davis, is trying to ensure that domestic farmworkers’ children have the STEM skills to compete for those jobs. De Leon Siantz is the daughter of Mexican immigrants; she has a Ph.D. in human development and focusses on migrant health in her research. She hopes to use existing Head Start and 4-H programs to teach math and engineering. “We want a way to get the kids out of the cycle,” she told me, referring to the cycle of poverty that traps so many agricultural laborers. “And the parents don’t want them to be farmworkers. If you even bring up the prospect of agricultural work to parents, it raises all kinds of alarms.” Bob Pitzer does similar work with young people as part of For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or FIRST, a program started by the inventor of the Segway, Dean Kamen. Some of FIRST’s alumni are now working for Harvest CROO. onally entered the crop-farm workforce in enough numbers to compensate for the loss of those Mexican workers—they’ve instead found jobs at meatpacking plants and in the service industries. arming—when to plant, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest—had been automated, but not the grunt work. In the state of agricultural work today, we can see, perhaps, the conditions that other industries will face when their workforces have been automated: the last jobs left will be the tough manual ones. The robots will be too smart to do them. ♦ large machine to physically carry those berries out in the field.” est bananas. p in that direction. Like the robotic weeder I saw at the U.C. Davis engineering lab, Harvest Croo’s strawberry machine incorporates G.P.S. in its precision-based approach. Eventually, the harvester will know the identity of all the strawberry plants in Wishnatzki’s fields and associate the data it collects about a particular plant with its virtual counterpart in the cloud. Every three days, as the machine passes over the growing berries, each of the cameras it carries will catch more than two hundred images per second. Pitzer likes to tell people that his harvester takes more pictures of strawberries in an afternoon than have ever existed before in the world.  hat he did not know of any growers in the state of Florida who got a response to their ads this past season.  cel his workforce. But the Harvest Croo robots actually did have the intelligence and the dexterity to pick a ripe strawberry. A new kind of power had come to the farm. ors, including the chef Tom Colicchio and Uber’s C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi. Fain has a persuasive pitch for why farms like Bowery are necessary. “By 2050, the U.N. predicts that the world will need seventy per cent more food than it currently produces, on less arable land, in a changing climate,” he told me when I met him in the industrial park that is the vertical farm’s asphalt heartland. “We need to waste less food and we need to increase yields in the developing world. How do you do it more efficiently and in a more sustainable way?” Bowery currently sells eight products—mixes of leafy greens and herbs—to Whole Foods, Foragers, and Sweetgreen. ler the bruises settle in,” Chris Parks told me.  which explores how future farmers might employ emerging technologies. Drones, for example, can automate the inspection of fields for pest or weed outbreaks, and can use high-resolution cameras and algorithmic processing of the images to pick up incipient problems before a farmer or a hired hand might spot them. Another possible application is plant breeding. Breeders currently rely on humans to evaluate seedlings produced by new combinations of already existing varieties. At a large operation, such as the University of Florida’s strawberry-breeding program, which is run by Vance Whitaker, people must manually inspect thousands of seedlings each year to see if any carries the desirable traits that the breeder is looking for. A robot, equipped with machine vision and enough artificial intelligence to recognize the traits the breeder is seeking, could automate the laborious process. n Valley which was co-founded by Brandon Alexander, a former Google X software engineer, the design of the open space allows a robotic arm to navigate through it, performing different farm chores—Iron Ox’s arm was the nearest thing I saw to an automated all-around farmhand. But even at Iron Ox humans are still required for “post-harvesting,” which means quality control and packaging.  berries arrive all at once, which would cause the price to fall. Up until recently, Wishnatzki has relied on cheap labor to get his berries picked—a fundamental of American agriculture, along with abundant land and water. needed to be inspected and delivered within certain time windows, when product is at its best.” ouses, many of them in rural areas, account for about half of the indoor market, but vertical farming has attracted significant venture capital. The “farmers” of these spaces are often entrepreneurs with no agricultural background, who have secured the funding to build the farms of the future. dustrial strawberry production is far from the trippy topography of the Beatles song. Under the rows is a network of PVC hoses and drip tape delivering water and fertilizers that cause the plants to produce Wish Farms’ huge, luscious strawberries until the end of April, when all the bushes and the plastic mulch are torn up and thrown away. The very largest of the berries I saw growing were the size of a plum. They were still attached to the plant, lying swollen and red on the dusty plastic, waiting for someone to pick them. th. Wish Farms picks, chills, and ships some twenty million berries—all handpicked by a seasonal workforce of six hundred and fifty farm laborers. nitially used for grains, such as wheat, rye, oats, and barley. They automated the manual labor formerly done by small armies of threshers and bundlers. Mechanical harvesters made industrial farming possible, and led to the consolidation of small family acreages into the megafarms that dominate U.S. agriculture today. “It was only those growers who first had access to the capital to buy the technology who could prevail,” Erik Nicholson, the national vice-president of the United Farm Workers, told me. “Those who didn’t could not compete and were run out of business, and their farms were put up for sale, and you had a dramatic consolidation of land in the Midwest.” en’t got to it yet.” It’s hardly worth it, when the workers are making minimum wage.   items to harvest their crops. Years of attempts to crack down on illegal immigration, both at the state and the federal level, partly explain these chronic shortages. In 2011, for example, Georgia enacted a strict immigration law that targeted undocumented workers and their employers. Later that year, the state reportedly lost eleven thousand crop workers. To fill the gap, officials established a program whereby nonviolent offenders nearing the end of their prison terms could do paid farmwork. The program had few takers, and many prisoners and probationers who did try it walked off the job, because the work was so hard. Georgia farmers lost more than a hundred and twenty million dollars. migrant who started out peddling fruits and vegetables from a pushcart in New York’s Washington Street Market in 1904.

The centre of semiconductor innovation from the 1960s on—hence the name—in the 1990s it made big bets on the internet, which by the 2000s it dominated. Since then its firms have created the operating systems on which more than 95% of the world’s smartphones run. gest political problem for American tech firms, in the Bay Area and elsewhere, is one that has proved beyond even the best-paid lobbyists. A lot of Americans are worried about immigration, and President Donald Trump is determined to act on their behalf. the big companies, where it is impossible for startups to operate. Innovation continues, but without the near-nutty breadth of approaches that used to be one of the area’s strengths. signing a new ten-year lease for a larger office space in nearby San Francisco. It decided not to. “A decade from now we’re going to be spending less time, not more time, in this area,” explains one of the partners. y started to outstrip its competitor in the late 1980s, she argued, because Route 128 was dominated by large, hierarchical companies that were inward-looking and secretive. They valued corporate loyalty and strongly discouraged employees from leaving for a competitor or starting their own venture. In the Valley, in contrast, information was shared much more freely both within companies and between them. Leaving to start something of your own was not frowned upon. Indeed it was encouraged; established firms helped support or spin off younger ones.  23 factors, such as employee compensation, retention, taxes, available funding, ease of access to other cities and the weather, the cities that Ms Haidar saw as runners up to first-choice Dallas were Phoenix, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado. The Kauffman Foundation, a think-tank, now ranks the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area as number one in America for startup activity. As each grows, each offers more opportunities for people who decide to move on from their current job. Internationally, Beijing and Shenzhen are hugely important. Admittedly, they mainly appeal to Chinese entrepreneurs who can speak the language and navigate the local business environment; but that is a big pool. And some foreigners are giving it a go, too. lley firms have pioneered let teams work productively across cities and time zones without ever meeting one another in person. The headquarters in Dallas to which Ms Haidar relocated WNDYR, the productivity startup, contains only four of its 33 employees.

The big firms can seize on novelty almost as quickly as startups do—and with a lot more oomph. ncing and collaborating online. By changing the way companies work, this technology is making it ever more feasible to have a presence in the Valley while keeping most or almost all of your employees elsewhere. No other tech hub in this more spread-out world will grow as powerful as Silicon Valley has been. But its lead over a growing pack of competitors will narrow. south from Palo Alto through 20 minutes of inevitable traffic to Sunnyvale and you will find a landmark of a different kind. Nothing of technological note has taken place there. But in February this small two-bedroom house, which boasts just the sort of garage a startup would once have felt at home in, sold for $2m, 40% more than its asking price, within two days of listing—a new record for the area. That translates into a price of $25,386 per square metre ($2,358 per square foot). burst. But the Valley has always kept climbing, and there are plenty who believe that, unequalled in its wealth and its claim on the world’s attention, it can go on doing so. Things may currently be unhelpfully overheated; some think a recession might clear out some badly run companies and lower costs for the fitter survivors. But the long-term outlook is cheery. “Florence was in its position for more than 200 years,” says Mike Volpi of Index Ventures, which invests in startups. “Silicon Valley still has many years to go.”  it is no longer the ferment it once was, and it is unlikely it will ever again dominate the technology world in quite the way it has over the past decades. The cost of living and operating a firm will drive more people away. The dominance of the companies that have generated its current wealth will change the paths to success for those who stay. And unfavourable governmental policies will further harm the Valley’s dynamism. singly “autarkic” culture that goes against the way that the Valley used to work, “shutting off the flow of talent.” “The problems of Boston,” she says, “are reappearing here”. ersity of California, Berkeley, to study computer science. After graduating she went to Y Combinator, the prominent boot camp for startups in Mountain View. In 2009 she started Indinero in San Francisco. What could be more Silicon Valley?  a timely manner, which the Bay Area desperately needs, San Franciscan politicians are in the midst of discussing legislating the abolition of corporate cafeterias in order to force techies to eat lunch out. Big new infrastructure projects to ease congestion and make it easier to get to work from further away are nowhere to be seen. Instead there are private luxury buses to the tech campuses—which became, a few years ago, the centre of the first big popular protests against the new elite. ities and to the Philippines. Today the firm employs 200 people, but only around 30 of them are in the Bay Area. Portland is its official headquarters. Ms Mah’s life is a ceaseless round of virtual meetings and real travel, but she reckons that building her startup in more affordable cities has enabled her to save millions of dollars. cial networking more than a decade old, people in tech are increasingly worried about what is next. Even if the Silicon Valley giants can spot it, they may not be best placed to capitalise on it; flexible as the giants are, they cannot do everything. If the new new thing takes off elsewhere, Silicon Valley’s advantages will be lessened. era, it could cause yet more activity to move closer to Seattle, where both firms reside and which is already a buzzing tech hub much cheaper to live and work in than the Valley. Other technologies which could conceivably pull power away from the Valley might include blockchains (see Technology Quarterly) or quantum computing. Blockchains are by their nature decentralised; quantum computing could reorient the tech world toward China. . Indeed a startup in a place with cheaper housing and less crowded freeways (even on a comfortable corporate bus with Wi-Fi, a two-hour commute is a pain) can become the poacher. San Francisco has many charms, but it is not particularly salubrious. People regularly encountering used drug needles, human excrement and sidewalks full of homeless people when they arrive home late at night at their $4,000-a-month one-bedroom flat in San Francisco sometimes think they might just prefer it elsewhere. arly employees at startups that made it big. Now profitable business models, piles of cash and soaring share prices mean giants can afford to pay employees handsomely. “The payoff of a higher-risk startup is not so different from what you would get over the same number of years at Google or Facebook earning top dollar,” explains Yelp’s Mr Stoppelman. ds of success are so slim. But when office space, homes and top talent were within the reach of young, unproven companies there was a constant spate of dreamers willing to try it. At today’s prices, the spate has slowed. Claire Haidar of WNDYR, a productivity startup that relocated to America from Ireland in 2017, reckons it costs at least four times as much to base a startup in the Bay Area as it would in most other cities in America. bably not as new, or as wild, as they would in a startup culture where the pool of other innovators with whom to team up would be larger and more diverse. The problem which dogged Route 128 has come to the Valley in a big way. “People join the big firms, and especially Apple, and they fall off the face of the earth. It’s a genuine problem for the ecosystem,” says John Lilly, a venture capitalist with Greylock.  For example, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, has raised a $100bn technology fund, which is more than the entire American venture-capital industry invested last year. And like both Hollywood and Wall Street, the Valley has its share of toxic masculinity and entrenched sexism. A mere 2% of venture-capital funding went to female founders’ startups last year. -maintenance movie stars. Those with graduate degrees in artificial intelligence can fetch $5m-10m a year. People complain that such pampering has eroded tech’s work ethic, with employees focusing on free lunches and other perks. In the Financial Times earlier this year Michael Moritz, chairman of the venture-capital firm Sequoia, suggested that American techies could learn from the hard-driving culture of Chinese entrepreneurs. everely restrict the number of foreigners who can receive work visas. Some tech firms have experienced delays of up to 18 months for foreign hires whom they might otherwise have been able to bring over swiftly. Students who come to America for degrees increasingly end up going home afterwards, willingly or not. “If you ask me ten years from now why Silicon Valley failed, it will be because we screwed up immigration,” predicts Randy Komisar of Kleiner Perkins, a venture-capital firm.  Silicon Valley. I don’t think I would,” says Jeremy Stoppelman, the boss of Yelp, a review site. “I will probably never scale another company in the Bay Area,” says one of the founders of a public internet company. He says that for his next venture he will keep a small team in the Bay Area but will hire most of the software developers and executives in other cities, where the cost of talent and the risk of them being poached are both lower.  says Mr Thiel. But it will be less critical to stay and set up shop here. “The Valley is going to become an idea instead of a place,” predicts Glenn Kelman, the boss of Redfin, a property company. “Wall Street went through a similar transformation,” he says, its name becoming shorthand for a whole industry. As tech firms set their sights on disrupting old-fashioned industries, like health care and logistics, they may find that it helps to be based in cities that claim deep expertise in these areas—and where garages housing startups are not just the stuff of museums and memory. or two nearby can be very important for such hubs, especially if they actively encourage commercial activity, as Stanford has. It also helps to have an “anchor tenant” that validates the place and draws employees there; they can then leave to start their own companies or work elsewhere. This is one reason that Seattle, home to the two of the world’s biggest five companies not based in the Valley, is doing so well. talists are not easily replicated. But it does well enough. “There are probably a dozen cities that are just as promising [as San Francisco in which] to start a tech company today,” says Peter Thiel, a feisty venture capitalist who will soon move from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a city which has welcomed many Valley refugees before him. It has its own growing tech scene—one that gained more attention when the online-media company Snap chose to set up shop there.",2

Instead, Trump remarkably claimed the higher death count was produced by the Democrats to make him look bad, when in fact it was produced by a nonpartisan institution. The president needs no help in looking bad. Almost without exception, President Trump fails to accept the responsibilities of the presidency, as expressed by former President Truman that “the buck stops here.” Moreover, either President Trump lives in an alternate reality, or he tries continually to make the public believe in such an alternate reality in which everything he does is above reproach. This only confirms the criticisms of Trump emanating from the White House as reported by Bob Woodward in his new book. Heaven help us all. and I have empathy for anyone abused by misuse of force.

Reality will teach us a lesson, sooner or later. The disappointing outcome of the two-child policy taught China such a lesson, for delaying its adjustment of the one-child policy.  for children’s education, a positive step.

The central government should clarify what exactly “responsible for family planning management and service work” and “improving family planning policy” mean, in order to guide public expectations. proportion of its population entering old age. Some demographers have called for the complete lifting of birth restrictions and even measures to encourage births. At the end of 2013, China began allowing parents who were only children themselves to have a second child. In 2016, it launched the two-child policy, which extended that permission to the entire population. However, the number of children born each year continues to fall below authorities’ expectations. y still struggle to quickly resolve the fundamental demographic problems it faces. ng its “demographic dividend,” with an unprecedented low birth rate, an aging society and a continually shrinking workforce. The effects of past controls on population growth will continue to linger in the foreseeable future. Under these circumstances, improving the quality of China’s workers is as urgent and is even more important than releasing birth restrictions. Improving the quality of the workforce and raising the efficiency of economic growth can, to a certain extent, compensate for the loss caused by the disappearance of the “demographic dividend.” f education resources to produce suitable workers for its transforming economy. However, the problem of uneven and unfair distribution of educational resources has become more and more serious. It has repeatedly triggered social unrest and threatened stability. The fundamental reason is that the reform of the education system has lagged behind reform in other areas — something the public feels strongly about. The education sector should confront the issue and resolve entrenched problems. idst of a shift in development patterns and industrial restructuring, and many low-skilled jobs will soon be eliminated or replaced by artificial intelligence technologies. If the population’s level of education is not raised as soon as possible, especially in rural areas, China’s workforce will struggle to meet the needs of high-quality development, and it will be difficult to achieve equality for the next generation. In addition, research has shown that China’s total factor productivity — a measure that reflects economic efficiency — has been declining since 2000. The country must pay attention to both the size of its population and the quality of its workforce, by means of deepening institutional reforms. Judging from long-term economic and social development patterns, the latter could even be more important. Some developed countries are already experiencing negative population growth, but their economies have not been seriously threatened. Instead, they have maintained high efficiency, largely because they have continuously improved the quality of their workforce and made technological advances. d to grow.

Said one businessman, “It just makes sense that there will be greater competition for a smaller pool of employees.” s passed, the Border Patrol grew to nearly 10,000 in 2001 and reached 17,499 by the end of the Bush presidency. This allowed Congress to strike a pose of determination to secure the border while still allowing the jobs magnet to draw hungry workers. Researchers at the Public Policy Institute of California did not find “a statistically significant relationship between the build-up and the probability of migration” and concluded that job opportunities “have a stronger effect on migration than does the number of agents at the border.”  . Senator Kamala Harris (D., Calif.) has suggested that immigration enforcement is the work of racist bigots. “We have to stop vilifying and criminalizing whole populations of people because they came and arrived here from south of the border!” she proclaimed last year. Meanwhile Trump, while declaring an urgent need for a wall across the Mexican border, has shown scant interest in repairing the virtual wall around the American jobs market that Congress long ago promised but has abjectly failed to deliver. interviews. Three thousand failed to show up and lost their jobs, while most of the others clarified their legal presence and went back to work. . Two months after Clinton was reelected, an exposé in the Boston Globe detailed Huang’s successful campaign in 1996 to persuade Clinton to reverse his early endorsement of Jordan’s proposal to end chain migration. The story began with the following revelation: “President Clinton made a last-minute about-face last year on his immigration policy, a reversal that brought the White House in line with the top priority of Asian-Americans who had paid $12,500 each a month earlier to attend a fund-raising dinner with Clinton that generated $1.1 million.” The dinner was hosted by Huang. It was Huang who had told Clinton in a memo that preservation of the preference for sibling immigration was the “top priority” of his people.   ed an operation to arrest dozens of unauthorized Mexican workers who were harvesting Georgia’s $80 million Vidalia onion crop. The farmers there had spurned the government’s H-2A visa program for temporary workers, complaining it was a bureaucratic tar pit. They resorted to the simple and cheap expedient of hiring workers with phony documents.  ificates to school and tribal records — some of which were produced in multiple formats. Moreover, employers had to accept any document that “reasonably appears on its face to be genuine.” In 1990 the Government Accounting Office (now known as the Government Accountability Office) began practically pleading with the INS to trim the permissible-documents list. Nine years later the agency, which has functioned like a Greek chorus in the worksite-enforcement drama, reported that the INS had “made little progress” in that effort. S. as children. He said his hand had been forced by congressional inaction on comprehensive reform. The following year, however, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill and Obama repeated the Bush administration’s strategy of ramping up worksite enforcement to demonstrate that he was serious about enforcement. The preferred Obama enforcement tactic was audits of employers’ records. Even though in 2013 ICE performed six times as many audits as it had done under the Bush administration in 2008, these 3,127 audits represented only a minuscule fraction of the nation’s 7 million–plus employers.  deprived that movement of its most powerful voice. Moreover, the left–right coalition was as forceful as ever. Cecilia Muñoz of the National Council of La Raza, echoing a civil-libertarian theme, called Jordan’s verification proposal “worse than Big Brotherism.” Pro-business activist Grover Norquist joined the fray as a lobbyist for Microsoft, which led the Silicon Valley charge against proposals to cut visas for high-tech workers. g illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign for the Republican nomination, Clinton declared that “American jobs belong to America’s legal workers.” He issued an executive order barring companies that had knowingly hired unauthorized workers from receiving government contracts. “When it comes to enforcing our nation’s immigration laws, we mean business,” he vowed. clear-power plants. Scant attention was paid to other areas of the economy. The GAO reported that in 2003 a mere 4 percent of agents’ time was devoted to worksite enforcement, down from 9 percent in 1999. By this time, the INS was gone, and worksite duties had been assumed by the newly formed ICE, which included former customs agents who were openly scornful of immigration enforcement. They preferred to go after cybercrime, money laundering, and drug trafficking. ence with immigration. He soon became aware of the interior-enforcement challenge posed by the burgeoning population of illegal immigrants drawn to the wide-open American labor market. At a 1990 Senate hearing, McNary acknowledged that his agents had been overwhelmed by the 100,000 calls the INS received annually from local law-enforcement agencies that had detained illegal immigrants and expected that the INS would pick them up. Describing the case of a Salvadoran man the INS declined to remove after arresting him for trespassing, McNary noted that because the man had not been convicted, he was not a priority. The man was then released, and he stole a pickup truck with which he killed two pedestrians. Local communities would grow increasingly frustrated with such cases. w-skill workers provides some benefits to the economy as a whole, . . . it also threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.” But he also advocated a sweeping amnesty — which he called “earned legalization.” And while he criticized worksite raids as excessive, he favored an overhaul of the notoriously defective verification program, which remained in place because of the power of those who benefited politically, economically, or ideologically from the fecklessness. mage Vanguard did to the processors but also to the cascading upstream effects on the state’s cattle and hog producers. Their big guns included former Nebraska governor (and future senator) Ben Nelson, a Democrat, and Iowa’s Republican senator Chuck Hagel. Nebraska governor (and future senator) Mike Johanns also got involved, appointing a task force that called for an amnesty for the state’s unauthorized workers. Johanns himself preferred more work permits and also called on the industry to boost wages in order to attract more workers to an industry that had once sustained a blue-collar middle-class workforce. ennedy. And so, starting in April 2006, ICE agents conducted a dozen major worksite operations, arresting several thousand unauthorized workers and some managerial personnel. Bush took the PR lead, striking the presidential pose of Horatius at the bridge as he declared that “a comprehensive reform bill must hold employers to account for the workers they hire.” The Washington Post cast doubt on the president’s commitment, observing that the administration had “virtually abandoned such employer sanctions before it began pushing to overhaul U.S. immigration law.” The reform bill was routed after a massive outpouring of populist opposition, which was revved up by such conservative talk-radio opponents as Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Michael Savage. olitical environment that smothers efforts to find common ground — is a result of the colossal failure of the last major immigration-reform law, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Known as IRCA, it stands as one of the most consequential failures of governance in our recent history, and we cannot understand how we got ourselves in this mess unless we understand how IRCA failed to earn its ambitious name. y an exhausted Congress after five years of rancorous debate, the reform was widely touted as a wise and moderate compromise. It combined the compassion of amnesty with a plan to stop future illegal immigration by requiring employers to verify that new hires were authorized to work. 1999 by Mark Reed, director of the INS Central Region, in response to an urgent request from the Nebraska and Iowa congressional delegations. At a meeting with Reed and Meissner, they told of a stream of complaints from furious constituents. “It was the old complaint,” Reed recalls. “The schools were being overrun. The health care was being overrun. The judicial system was being overrun. Basically, their lifestyle was being overrun because we were unable to stop the flow of people across the border.” ocal unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, the factory owners had recruited unauthorized Central American immigrants, provided them with phony identification papers, paid them the minimum wage or less, manipulated records to deny overtime pay, and imposed sweatshop conditions including $20 fines for bathroom breaks longer than two minutes. “Now I understand how they kept outbidding me,” said a competitor. of mistreatment of workers, trafficking, smuggling, harboring, visa fraud, document fraud, and other violations.” And so the word went out that the Obama administration had kept the de facto threshold for enforcement well above the de jure standard Congress had established so ineffectively in 1986. bout the law’s requirements. “His yardstick was not ‘How many fines did we issue this month,’” one former INS official recalls. “It was ‘How many people did we educate this month.’” s somebody to step in behind them,” said John Brechtel, who supervised INS investigations in Los Angeles. Taking down a single counterfeiting operation there, agents seized 115,000 blank documents — including green cards and Social Security cards — with an estimated street value of $5 million. itiative to deny them state services. Clinton was wary of a challenge in the 1996 presidential election from the state’s Republican governor, Pete Wilson, who rode populist anger at the illegal influx to reelection in 1994. Clinton dispatched Attorney General Janet Reno to the West Coast, where she supervised the launch of “Operation Gatekeeper,” an initiative to boost border defenses. “We will not rest until the flow of illegal aliens has abated,” she declared. While Gatekeeper eased Clinton’s political problems, it simply diverted the illegal influx eastward into Arizona, which then bore the brunt of the problem. It also set a precedent that has been followed ever since: Throw billions at border security to demonstrate your toughness, while doing little to secure the worksite. n a potentially expanding pattern of extended-family immigration. erious about responding to grassroots concerns, Vanguard demonstrated the futility of cracking down on a powerful industry that had become addicted to unauthorized workers. Illegal immigration from Mexico and Central America, drawn by the economic boom of the late 1990s and the fecklessness of worksite enforcement, continued. Border Patrol arrests on the southwest border, which never dipped below 1,270,000 per year between 1995 and 2001, reached their all-time high of 1,643,679 in 2000, a daily average of 4,503. facto member of the Clinton campaign staff. Echoing her boss and a campaign slogan, she declared that the INS “means business when it comes to enforcing immigration laws in the workplace.”  (D., Mont.) sponsored an amendment to an immigration-reform bill before the Senate that would strengthen E-Verify, an online verification system, by mandating a process in which employers would match a photo submitted by new hires with a digital photo stored in a government database of authorized workers. Lamenting the long history of failed verification, Portman pointed to the “unholy alliance” of the left–right coalition whose dubious legacy is IRCA’s failure, and warned his colleagues that the immigration-reform bill, which eventually passed the Senate, would not work. Senate majority leader Harry Reid did not permit a vote on the Portman-Tester amendment.",2

From his comments it seems that he (and Pelosi, Sanders, etc.) seems to think that giving “free” money and “free” healthcare to people automated out of a job will allow them to become artisans – set up a little business making hand-made trinkets and works of art that will be purchased by whom?  Sure there might be 0.5% of the displaced population with the God given talent and inner-drive to make it as an artist, but for the rest the money will much more likely end up going to a purchase of some substance they can put up their nose or inject into a vein.  The problem that most of these “genius” types have is they have no idea how the bottom half lives, and so they just imagine what they themselves would do if they would get “free” money and not have to work, because unlike the bottom half they have the IQ, education, skills, personality, etc. to enjoy reading books, taking courses, do arts and crafts, working out and playing golf, mentoring/tutoring kids, writing articles and comments on Quillette, etc.  But how many of these things will be “productive” outlets for a high school drop-out with an IQ of 85, no interest/abilities to write, read, paint, sculpt, sing, workout, tutor, mentor, and some destructive personal habits ranging from overeating to alcohol/drug addiction.  The more painful question is whether society is doing a favor to people who have perhaps permanently lost their economic and social purpose by subsidizing their existence and procreation with “free” healthcare and “free” money.  Even if society could afford such policies financially, the rise of the welfare state has already created an epidemic of single parent households, obesity, drug addiction, violence and criminal activity that is pretty much limited to the lower classes who are the primary “beneficiaries” of the welfare state, so how is expanding it further going to help? g to the point that our post-World War II approaches are no longer feasible.  key generation (or even some sort of brute force seed algorithm) in twitch games?

And so, trying to force companies to change their employment models, and then empowering workers through unions to do so, might be the right thing to do in some contexts; but in my opinion, it’s highly unlikely to solve the problem because we’ve been heading in this direction for decades, and in some ways Bernie Sanders’ solution is an attempt to turn back the clock. teresting and seemingly creates the needs for longer and larger experiments.

The best way to do so is to give Americans a raise. good thing. If you think jobs are a way to maintain social order and make sure that someone has to be somewhere for certain shifts of the day—and that, without that, that person would struggle to find a degree of structure or purpose—then maybe you say, let’s make these fast food companies employ people just for the sake of it.

To fund the UBI you have to take the money from somewhere — the business owner?  For localized businesses like groceries, restaurants, etc that’s easy.  All the automated manufacturing leaves as it did with human manufacturing.  What then?  Tariffs?  The money has to come from somewhere.  Robotic automation is simply on-shore outsourcing.  There is a new labor supply that is cheap so it displaces the prior labor supply.

More recent versions would have nonprofit groups and state and local governments act as the employers, with the federal government playing a secondary role as a provider of training. The basic idea is that every citizen would have a job at a decent-enough wage to cover housing, transportation and food. Booker’s legislation would create federally funded pilot programs in up to 15 communities. Most proposals would also provide benefits such as health care and sick leave. b at $15 an hour would prompt those already working -- often without benefits -- to leave their lower-paid jobs. And that would force companies to compete, triggering wage inflation that could lower profits or drive some companies out of business. The Federal Reserve might also have to raise interest rates to stop the economy from overheating, which could throw people out of work and add to the cost of a job guarantee. It’s also a big policy shift, requiring political and voter backing because it would mark a substantial reshaping of the U.S. labor economy.    assumes the program would employ 15 million people largely in public-service jobs at nonprofit organizations, in public schools and in state and local governments.

U.S. economists who studied the program reported in 2018 that it increased earnings of low-income households by 13 percent. Most of that was due to higher wages and increased work in the private sector, not from the program itself. In other words, it worked as advocates predicted: The program pushed up wages and increased employment everywhere.

Some economists say the total unemployed, underemployed and uncounted is 16 million, when also factoring in those who want a job but haven’t looked in the past year or haven’t been available to work for a variety of reasons. What’s more, real wage growth (adjusted for inflation) remains stagnant. About a third of the workforce makes $15 an hour or less, according to the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute. Political analysts say these factors contributed to the election of President Donald Trump, whose 2016 campaign tapped into voters’ economic angst with calls for tighter immigration controls, protectionism and a revival of old-line manufacturing.  for an expanded Bill of Rights that included the right to employment.

Keynes rejected the former while continuing to accept the microeconomics of the latter.  For the classical economists of the early 19th century capitalism, there was no distinction between the micro and the macro.  The task was to analyse the motion and trends in ‘economies’ and for that a theory of value was a necessary tool but not an end in itself. te of interest… since it seems likely that the fluctuations in the market estimation of the marginal efficiency of different types of capital, calculated on the principles I have described above, will be too great to be offset by any practicable changes in the rate of interest”.  And so Keynes moved on to advocating fiscal spending and state intervention to complement or pump-prime failing business investment.  Pettifor has latched onto that part of Keynesian macro theory and policy, monetary easing, to the neglect of fiscal stimulus, let alone the more radical policy of the ‘socialisation of investment’ (not even mentioned by Pettifor).  Thus Pettifor’s account of Keynes’s economics is at his least ‘revolutionary’.  and not limited in its production, so society can print as much of it as it likes in order to invest in its social choices without any detrimental economic consequences.  And through the Keynesian multiplier effect, incomes and jobs can expand.  And “it makes no difference where the government invests its money, if doing so creates employment”.  The only issue is to keep the cost of money, interest rates, as low as possible, to ensure the expansion of money (or is it credit?) to drive the capitalist economy forward.  Thus there is no need for any change in the mode of production for profit; just take control of the money machine to ensure an infinite flow of money and all will be well. eve that, she relies entirely on the theories and policies of JM Keynes and ‘Keynesianism’.  Recently she published a short article for the prestigious Times Literary Supplement, entitled The indefatigable efforts of J.

Just trying to get the official interest rate down would not be enough.  But by 1936 after five more years of depression (similar to the time since the Great Recession now), Keynes became less convinced that ‘unconventional monetary policies’ would work.  In his famous General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes moved on. yment was full and incomes high.  So (macro) economics could appear to provide policies to ‘manage’ capitalism successfully.  But this was just a momentary illusion.  The golden age soon lost its glitter.  Keynesian theory and policy was exposed with the first simultaneous international recession of 1974-5 and was followed by the deep slump of 1980-2.  Remember these major collapses in production and investment internationally took place during the supposed operation of Keynesian policies of macroeconomic management, in Pettifor’s account.  and thus devalue the national currency, and/or inflate financial asset prices.  It is the latter that has mostly happened in the recent period of money printing.  Quantitative easing has not ended the current global depression but merely sparked new financial speculation.

DeVos’s reply: “The Office for Civil Rights is committed to protecting the civil rights as determined under the law of this land, and we do so proudly and with great focus each day.” DeVos’s use of a circular definition when stating OCR’s mission betrays her lack of understanding and appreciation for the essential work the office does.    Department should increase its capability -- not bar victims from seeking justice. In fact, Congress recently increased funding to OCR for the 2018 fiscal year by $8.5 million to help the office secure the resources necessary to investigate instances of discrimination. So, with congressional support and funding, and a patently obvious need for discrimination watchdogs in education, it brings up the question: Why won’t Betsy DeVos defend civil rights in higher education institutions? Why limit access to an office whose mission is to protect victims of discrimination?    other places that receive federal funding, in accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. DeVos unilaterally -- and without a public comment period -- decided to change policies to allow the OCR to ignore a large swath of civil rights complaints. f Education is allowing discrimination to fester and worsen. In May we heard the story of Lolade Siyonbola, a black graduate student at Yale University.

She explained her actions, stating that complaints to the OCR present “an unreasonable burden” to the office. Furthermore, OCR will stop reviewing repeat complaints put forth by the same party and will block appeals to its rulings. But unlike the Justice Department, the Education Department cannot pick and choose the cases it pursues. Until this precipitous and unconstitutional change in case handling, if the office has evidence that the law has been violated, then it typically must open a case.   and DeVos to restore the full power and capability of the OCR and to make civil rights a priority during her tenure at the Department of Education.  nts and students from low-income households.

That’s why I’m puzzled by the existence of women’s leadership conferences. t while we all struggle to understand gender inequity. ng for women in the workforce certainly is valuable. However, at the end of these leadership conferences, how many women advanced their career trajectory in a meaningful way?  al analysis of soft benefits can be revealing. Analyzing the usage breakdown by gender for tuition, trainings, conferences, expense accounts, club memberships and attendance at political events are just a few areas of opportunity. Gender balanced work activities invite dialogue (the antidote to stereotyping and the perpetuation of biases), that socializes integration and supports the development of gender partnerships.

It crystallized for me when I inadvertently caught one of these idiotic political ads during election season. One of the GOP candidates was attemtping to besmirch a Dem by saying they supported universal health care which would cost every family in the state over $8000. And I am thinking well lets see, next year just my insurance premiums will be almost $30,000 and that is before we actually use any health care. If next year is like this year that means I will spend near $35,000 on insurance copayments and coninsurance. God if I could be taxed $8000 instead of that I would gladly take the trade. The thing is that in 2010 we needed health care reform. As a wealthy nation we cannot watch uninsured people die nor people who suffer “pre-existing conditions” which is farcical in the insurance worl struggle to be able to pay.

An increase in 17 percent to $779 billion in deficit for the last fiscal year. I’m sure you’re probably hopeful that the tax cuts will pay for themselves long term. But how much do you worry now about that growing deficit and the debt on economic growth and interest rates going forward?   And so, for me, there are two major pillars. One is the economic pillar. The second is the education pillar. And if our goal is to make sure that we spread opportunities and success throughout this nation in an even way, we have to focus first on the education system, particularly the education system in the poorest parts of this country. A poor education system or a failing school typically leads to higher unemployment. Higher unemployment typically leads to more government services. And frankly, obviously, it leads to lower net worth. The correlation, of course, is that education and opportunity are like wet and water. They are very difficult to separate.  ea Jones for POLITICO   do you think we got to this point?  ins in Greenville. And so you could see the development of a support company for the Boeing Corporation here in North Charleston, whether it’s providing paint for the planes, or rubber for the wheels, or any other aspect of the engineering for the planes, there’s a ton of opportunities out there that you could see. The second example would be, we are heading towards a service economy in South Carolina. So while we’re going to continue to celebrate our success as a manufacturing headquarters, we are, at some point in the future, going to become what we call the “Silicon Harbor” in Charleston, in the upstate. We’re going to have a focus on the jobs of the future. And so you could see a company started in the Medical University of South Carolina spill into an opportunity zone. And as that company grows, you would see how quickly investors might find it attractive … not only do you have the tax deferral from your initial tax burden, but as your company starts to grow in that zone, that growth is capital gains tax free during those first 10 years of your growth. m investment in one of these zones, then you can defer—you don’t eliminate, but you defer—your capital gains tax for up to 10 years, or through the year 2026. So it’s a phenomenal incentive for people to take a second look at areas that they would not necessarily pay attention to because they would feel like the return is too low, or the risk is too high. e Scott’s can turn into boondoggles that give tax breaks to wealthy investors without doing much for the places they’re supposed to help. In a paper earlier this year, Adam Looney, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said there isn’t good evidence that tax incentives actually boost low-income local residents; Empowerment Zones, a previous government effort to boost troubled areas, wound up costing $850 per resident and in the end was limited to just 11 neighborhoods.  this economic divide during Donald Trump’s presidency.  to address this problem of access to opportunity? that the tax cuts, so far, have actually increased revenues to the federal government, not decreased it. So we’ve cut taxes, but we always have believed in the Laffer Curve or the inverse relationship.  Unfortunately, at the exact same time, what we’re seeing is that spending has not leveled off, it’s not plateaued. It continues to increase. About 70—maybe it’s 67 percent—67 percent of the budget is on automatic increase because those are our mandatory spending programs.  We are going to have to not look at cutting benefits for our current people. That’s one of the fictional stories that you can find out there. You can actually reduce our long-term exposure without touching current beneficiaries, or, frankly, people within a 10-year window of receiving their benefits from an entitlement perspective of Medicare and Social Security. But we do have to wrestle with the long-term consequences of mandatory spending that we haven’t wrestled with before. But in order for that to happen, we’re going to have to do that in a bipartisan fashion or it just will not happen.    ave been missed by the economic recovery that we’ve experienced over the last few years. In the Opportunity Zones, the poverty rate is over 30 percent.

And frankly, there’s typically an uneven success trajectory. There have been communities that have been mired in poverty for generations. And the real question is, how do we break that cycle? One of the ways that you do that is by making sure that the private sector, the free markets, have the ability to operate fully. When that happens, you see the most even spread of our resources. As an example, 10 years ago, the African American unemployment was about 12 or 13 percent. Less than six months ago, it was under 6 percent. Today, it’s in the low 6 percent range. What happens is, as we grow the pie, we see more folks being able to engage in finding and chasing the American dream, which is the fastest way to actually even out the recovery. I think we’ve seen that number improve for every minority group.  eased proposed rules to guide investors on how to take advantage of the tax incentives. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has suggested that the program could attract $100 billion in investment in distressed areas. s are a prerequisite for success in most of America. I think what you’re going to see in the next 10 to 15 years, and you’re seeing it start now, is the fact that people can live where they want to and then decide the type of work they want to do. Our economy is absolutely moving in the direction of people deciding the quality of life they want, the location they want. And then later deciding on the job they want because of the ability to work from home. So the truth is that we’ll probably see more opportunities in rural America than we’ve ever seen before, as people have the chance to pick and choose their site and then their jobs. That is going to be a unique experience for many people in the workforce because, up until now, they really haven’t had that as a real option.  rtain areas while leaving others behind. “We always struggle with an even spread of resources,” he said, noting that one way government can address this is to ensure better access to broadband internet outside of major metropolitan centers.",0

This is true at the international level and in most countries’ responses. In the US itself, the political and rhetorical space has narrowed even further, with child sex trafficking emerging as the dominant priority. With some occasional missteps, particularly in its early years, the report has remained true to the broader understanding of what exploitation in the context of trafficking actually means. A continuation and consolidation of that position is critical. l or poorly developed criminal justice systems. But the ambassador and his office must be clear on the point that trafficking is a serious crime and that failure to prosecute and punish offenders makes a government complicit in the harm. It is hard to make the criminal justice process work well for victims, but our professional experience confirms that measures can be put in place to minimize trauma and support trafficked persons to cooperate in the prosecution of their exploiters. ce to suggest an increased ‘gaming’ of the assessment system: that countries under scrutiny and their defenders are becoming ever more adept at presenting an illusion of progress, without undertaking the root and branch reforms necessary to address exploitation meaningfully. The ambassador and his team will need to reassert proactively the integrity of the assessment process. ment of an experienced and committed civil rights prosecutor to the top job gives some weight to recent indications that the Trump administration takes the issue seriously and is committed to a newly invigorated anti-trafficking effort. But there are also reasons for caution. The ambassador must be prepared for resistance to a rigorous, principled approach to trafficking that inevitably requires strong commitment to universal human rights and the rule of law. al prostitution policies. The office also needs to demonstrate a firm commitment to confronting the many forms of exploitation, from forced labour to the global organ trade, that are still not receiving the attention and response they deserve. John Cotton Richmond’s own words and his impressive track record prosecuting a wide range of trafficking crimes give cause for optimism. bust measures to seize and impound slave-made goods in international commerce. While advocating technical responses to inadequate prosecution efforts, the new ambassador must be prepared to expose the stark disconnect between what governments say and what they do. Like so many other crimes that predominantly affect women, the marginalized and the powerless, trafficking is just not a high priority in the criminal justice system of any country. Until that uncomfortable truth is openly acknowledged and addressed, meaningful change will be impossible. singly seen to be the magic bullets in dealing with trafficking, especially in respect of forced and exploited labour.

But the position comes with heavy baggage. As the ambassador takes the helm, he should not underestimate the formidable task ahead of him.  dor should strongly support efforts to bring the private sector in as key partners. But he also needs to be clear that the recent wave of action is nowhere near enough. ntry (including its own, since 2010) to trafficking.

With some studies placing the number of victims of trafficking upwards of 40 million, these figures are truly astonishing, confirming both virtual impunity for offenders at a scale unmatched by any other crime, and an unconscionable lack of justice for victims. d experience has taught us the hard lesson that voluntary or self-regulation is unlikely to make a long-term positive impact. s in the Gulf to forced labourers on Thai fishing boats and Greek strawberry farms, forced marriage in the UK and forced prostitution in Italy.

The resulting report, Getting There First – How to Win the Battle for Campus talent in the US, is based on in-depth interviews with a wide range of big name employers, such as GE, Google, BNP Paribas, Medtronic, Rolls Royce and Merck & Co., and shows how the way such organizations find and hire talent is creating a whole raft of opportunities for those willing to embark on the job hunt with the seriousness it merits.  homore or even freshman year through informal events which happen as early as campus orientation. And on some campuses you may even find a GE employee helping with the heavy lifting as freshmen move into their dorms or apartments. No matter how immersed you might be on the newness of college life and the prospect of lectures and exams ahead, this is the ideal time to begin making connections that will get you clearly on a potential employer’s radar. of U.S. campus recruiting at BNP Paribas, says in the report, “It’s obviously difficult to accurately measure talent so early on…but there are plenty of early indicators such as academic performance, the selection of tough majors, membership of ‘hard to access’ clubs and societies and a demonstrable interest in the business of finance.” So start doing all you can to build a compelling profile as soon as you can. eem to believe that an internship of some form is the most logical and effective entry point. However the research found many companies admitting that, in too many cases in the past, students had been taken into internships simply because that’s what the organization had always done and not necessarily because there were specific and obvious full-time jobs in prospect at the end of them. However, that appears to be changing dramatically to make any internship a genuine ‘working interview.’ As Amy Wilson, director of early career talent at Medtronic says in the report, “It’s vital to have a robust planning process...to align on what we need both for short-term summer projects, but more importantly, for long-term career prospects.” Campus job hunters should consequently think about asking both smart, but also potentially tough questions about where an internship is actually going to lead. er, Instagram and LinkedIn and dedicated tools such as HireVue. Student job hunters consequently need to embrace every opportunity possible to link up with a prospective employer in this way and, perhaps most importantly, to take part in virtual events, such as hackathons, which allow participants to show hard evidence of their relevant skills and capabilities. However, in the course of their research, Alexander Mann Solutions didn’t find a single, significant employer that had completely given up on visiting campuses in person.

Instead, look at where the real talent gaps are in the market and then aim for the one that fits your individual circumstances. Even before selecting a college that means thinking about exactly which program is going to give best bang for buck. While many big companies admit that they have to prioritise particular universities because of finite hiring resources they also say that their target list is now more flexible than it might have been in the past and will embrace specific innovative programs on less obvious campuses, particularly in areas such as cyber-security, machine learning and AI. It also means understanding how many employers are making huge efforts to increase workforce diversity, for example by bending over backwards to bring more women into roles based around the all-important STEM subjects. ander Mann Solutions research is that many of the old rules of engagement still remain in place. One interviewee in the report says, in what was doubtless a somewhat exasperated tone, that she still has to advise candidates to dress smartly for a video interview and, if that interview is happening in their dorm, then the background doesn’t look like a bomb has gone off in it.

In tight labour markets, employers tend to increase hiring from groups that find it harder to land a job or are under-represented in the labour market. For instance, over the past five years, as the pool of unemployed people has shrunk, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities have accounted for a rising share of new hires. Food and beverage service, healthcare and IT have increased hiring of minorities most, while retail, cleaning, and food and beverage service have hired more people with disabilities.   lost if employees leave, employers have incentive to retain staff by raising pay or modifying the workplace in ways that employees value.

Countries with strong quality assurance systems like Australia apply surveys to employers on a systematic basis to capture their views on the quality of training provision. The Employers Use and Views on the Quality of the VET system (see link), carried out bi-annually, measures the degree to which employers perceive they have a choice in selecting public and private training providers to work with, their level of satisfaction with providers, and their overall satisfaction with the skills system. ses miembros.  leads the way in training quality assurance in the Caribbean. d with attribution to the IDB and for any non-commercial purpose.

While these trends are happening more slowly in Latin America and the Caribbean than in developed countries, it is worrying that according to the World Economic Forum’s Human Capital Index, next to Africa, Latin American and Caribbean countries have the lowest skill levels (see The Future of Work Regional Perspectives). On the one hand, the inadequate supply of skills can prevent countries from attracting new industries that can help them ride the digital wave, creating new jobs, and maybe even developing new competitive niches in the digital economy. On the other, once digital trends reach the region, the inadequate supply of skills could result in displacement of workers as the skills of existing workers become obsolete.  ture of work, public-private partnerships for skills development, and youth employment. Co-author of the publication “Apprenticeships for the XXI Century: A Model for Latin America and the Caribbean?”, over the past few years she has advised governments in the Caribbean and Central America on the design of national apprenticeship programs and other types of skills development programs. Before joining the IDB, Raquel worked in Economics Unit of the Sustainable Development Department for the Latin American and Caribbean Region of the World Bank and at the Competitiveness Promotion Council in her home country, Costa Rica.

These indicators are submitted on a learner by learner basis to the government based upon which providers receive a scorecard showing their actual and relative position with respect to other providers. Very importantly, all of this data is made publicly available so that learners and employers can make informed choices about education and training (see link). ns are carried out adequately. Quality assurance refers to the mechanisms through which a skills development system can ensure that the objectives or vision established by the system are met, that the quality of inputs including physical teaching infrastructure like schools and labs, teaching materials, teachers, instructors, and leadership is high, and that the results of the training provision in terms of educational outcomes and labor market outcomes are positive. Quality assurance is therefore very much related to a skill development system’s ability to continuously evaluate itself against a set of quality standards and take measures to improve itself where and when necessary. d juvenil, inserción laboral y programas de aprendices, principalmente en el Caribe así como en investigación relacionada a estos temas.

Training providers are using this industry-approved assessment to benchmark the extent to which their programs are producing quality results that are valued by employers. ically, effective skills development systems perform four main functions (see Amaral et. al): (i) systematically identify present and future skills needs; (ii) translate these skills needs into curricula to be delivered by an ecosystem of training providers; (iii) allocate resources efficiently; and (iv) have mechanisms to ensure that the quality of training provision meets the highest standards. In a world where technological change is rapidly shifting skills demands, it is critical that skills development systems are flexible and dynamic so that they can be truly responsive to changes in the labor market. the answer lies in countries’ skills development systems and more specifically, in the quality of the education and training provided by these systems.  nas en Honduras en la supervisión/ejecución de proyectos haciendo un periodo en el Banco Mundial como Junior Professional Associate en la preparación de la estrategia de país.

After all, Americans have acquired more education and are more productive than ever before. Yet, as it turns out, our feelings of being ripped off are justified. More than 80 percent of us are not reaping the bounty of our own education and productivity. For while unemployment is technically at a historic low point, underemployment is rampant. Fully 20 percent of men aged 24 to 55 do not have full-time jobs, and nearly half of all new college graduates are unable to find a job that comports with their education.

People have always shifted away from work better done by machines, but the economic principle of “comparative advantage” predicts that humans will maintain an edge in many fields.

Theoretically, this will free these drivers to fill new roles—such as ones in Amazon warehouses. But these warehouses are also becoming automated, as are any number of other places with jobs once filled by the vast majority of what economists call “middle-skill workers,” the very people who once populated—and bolstered—the American middle class.

In a recent report, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak soothed the fears of Amazon shareholders concerned with the wage increase by pointing out that automation had already and would continue to reduce the call for labor, and therefore reduce overall costs. When asked about this, Lobaugh again tactfully declined to comment—other than to say that while the retail sector had lost less ground than most people assume, retail employees were another matter. “There are winners,” he says, “and then there are losers.” r a city that in earlier times was the nation’s largest manufacturer of wire—barbed wire, electrical wire, telephone wire and the wire used in the making of undergarments by the Royal Worcester Corset Co., once the largest employer of women in the United States.

Sawyer is the brainchild of Rodney Brooks, the inventor of both Roomba, the robotic vacuum, and PackBot, the robot used to clear bunkers in Iraq and Afghanistan and at the World Trade Center after 9/11. Unlike Roomba and PackBot, Sawyer looks almost human—it has an animated flat-screen face and wheels where its legs should be. Simply grabbing and adjusting its monkey-like arm and guiding it through a series of motions “teaches” Sawyer whatever repeatable procedure one needs it to get done. The robot can sense and manipulate objects almost as quickly and as fluidly as a human and demands very little in return: While traditional industrial robots require costly engineers and programmers to write and debug their code, a high school dropout can learn to program Sawyer in less than five minutes. Brooks once estimated that, all told, Sawyer (and his older brother, the two-armed Baxter robot) would work for a “wage” equivalent of less than $4 an hour. uding in the kitchen. When we spoke, he was putting the final touches on a device that uses software to concoct beautifully composed gourmet delights from a jumble of pastes, gels, powders and liquid ingredients. From the looks of it, this machine could compete with a three-star Michelin chef and her entire staff. When I ran this thought by Lipson, he groaned. He says scientists and engineers like himself have a reflexive urge to automate almost every difficult task. The whole point of engineering, he says, is to alleviate drudgery and increase productivity; in the past, that was almost always the right thing to do, the good thing to do. But now he’s not so sure.  to weigh evidence fairly, without prejudice or false assumptions. Perhaps most critically, machines can retain and process data far more accurately than we can, and that data is growing exponentially. square foot of store space and tend to offer low wages and fewer hours: The number of hours per employee has actually dropped over the past decade. John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, a Chicago-based global outplacement & career transitioning firm, said he sees more changes ahead. “I think we’re in the opening phase of what happened to manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s,” he says. “There’s no question that store workers are vulnerable to technology and that untold numbers have already been displaced.”  ",2
